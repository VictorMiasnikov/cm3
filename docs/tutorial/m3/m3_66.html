<h2><a name="SEC66"></a><a name="SEC66"></a><a name="SEC66"></a><a href="m3_toc.html#SEC66" NAME="SEC66">Simple
Compile Example</a></h2>

<p>Here we describe how you can compile a simple program using &quot;<tt>cm3</tt>&quot;.

<p> The easiest way to build packages is using CM3-IDE. Visit the
<a href=/form/new-pkg><strong>Create Package</strong></a> form to
create a new package within the CM3-IDE environment. CM3-IDE will
allow you to select a package root (where your package will reside),
package name, and package kind, before creating the package. Once you
have created a package, you may use the <b>Build</b> button to compile
its sources.

<p>You can also create and compile sources without using
   the CM3-IDE environment.  The instructions in this tutorial will
guide you through creating and compiling a package by hand, from a
Unix command-line shell. Creating a package by hand on a DOS
command-line shell on Win32 platforms is also similar.

<h4>
<hr width="100%" >Using the Command&nbsp;Line Interface</h4>

<p>What if I you wanted to use the command line interface?&nbsp;Here we
describe how to build a simple program that we presented earlier in <a href="m3_1.html#SEC1">Writing
Programs</a>. First, you need to create a package directory for this program.
Let's say you create a directory <tt>~/proj/simple</tt> for this purpose.
Then you need to create a subdirectory called '<tt>src</tt>' in that directory
to hold the m3makefile and source code file Main.m3. (You don't have to
create an &quot;src&quot; directory, but most Modula-3 packages do so as
a convention.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>So you should have the following two files in the given directories:
</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>~/proj/simple/src/Main.m3 </tt></li>

<li><tt>~/proj/simple/src/m3makefile </tt><i>(optional)</i></li>
</ul>

<p><tt>While in ~/proj/simple</tt> directory, issue the "<code>cm3</code>" command
to build your program. If your <code>m3makefile</code> is correctly formatted and the
<code>Main.m3</code> is correct, the compiler will create a build directory <tt>~/proj/simple/TARGET&nbsp;</tt>(where
<tt>TARGET&nbsp;</tt>is the name of your platform, e.g., <tt>SPARC</tt>
or <tt>NT386</tt>) and place in it the executable file <tt>myprog</tt>.
To execute the program, enter the command <tt>SPARC/myprog</tt> at the
command prompt. </p>

<h4>
<hr width="100%" >Tools for Building Small and Large Programs</h4>

<p>For very simple program such as this one, you could have easily created
an Main.m3 file, and just typed:</p>

<ul>
<pre>$ cm3 Main.m3</pre>
</ul>

<p>at the command line, even without an m3makefile.</p>

<p>For large programs, however, you will find that the structuring tools
available with Modula-3 will help you easily create very sophisticated
multi-platform programs.</p>
