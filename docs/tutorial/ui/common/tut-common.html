<h3>Appendix A:  Auxiliary Modules</h3>

Some of the example programs used the modules <code>Colors</code>
and <code>Pictures</code>.
These modules are not part of Trestle or VBTKit.
They were written for the use of the example programs.
In order to be complete, we give the code for these
modules in their entirety here.
<p>

The module <code>Colors</code>,
as defined in the interface file
<a href="../common/Colors.i3">Colors.i3</a>,
provides Trestle objects of type <code>PaintOp.T</code>
corresponding to some common colors used by the example programs.
The implementation of the module is
<a href="../common/Colors.m3">Colors.m3</a>.
<p>

The module <code>Pictures</code>,
as defined in the interface file
<a href="../common/Pictures.i3">Pictures.i3</a>,
provides two graphic VBT's formed from two bitmapped images.
One picture is of a rare stamp, the other is a picture
of a windmill.
The implementation of the module is
<a href="../common/Pictures.m3">Pictures.m3</a>.
