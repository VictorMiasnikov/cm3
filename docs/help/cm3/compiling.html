<h2>Compiling programs</h2>

<p>The program that builds Modula-3 programs is <tt>cm3</tt>. In fact <tt>cm3
</tt>is both a compiler and a builder. It is used in preference to <tt>make</tt>,
in part because Modula-3 uses a more sophisticated dependency analysis
than <tt>make</tt>, and in part to provide a smaller, simpler, and more
portable descriptions than are found in most <tt>makefiles</tt>. </p>

<p>Before diving into a detailed description of <tt><a href="m3build/m3build.html">cm3</a></tt>,
consider the following simple <a href="example.html">example</a>. </p>
