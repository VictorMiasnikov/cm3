<H2>Garbage collection</H2>
<P>

A crucial fact for clients of the garbage collector to know is that
<EM>objects in the heap move</EM>.  If all references to a traced heap object
are from other traced heap objects, the collector may move the
referent.  Hence, it is a bad idea to hash pointer values.  References
from the stack or untraced heap into the traced heap are never
modified.
<P>

The current collector is, by default, incremental and generational.  
The interruptions of service should be very small, and the overall 
performance should be better than with the previous collectors.
<P>

The use of VM protection has become obsolete by the addition of
compiled-in hints for garbage collection since CM3 5.4.
Now <A HREF="m3args.html"><TT>@M3novm</TT></A> is the default.
<P>

Note that the new optional background collection 
thread is not on by default; this may change in the future.
<P>

When you debug a Modula-3 program with
<A HREF="../m3gdb/m3gdb-onepage.html"><TT>m3gdb</TT></A>,
you will find it simplest to 
run it with the <A HREF="m3args.html"><TT>@M3novm</TT></A> switch.
More information on
<A HREF="debugging.html#GC">debugging</A>
in presence of the VM-synchronized garbage
collector is available here.
<P>
<a href="../m3gdb/m3gdb-onepage.html"><tt>m3gdb</tt></a> has its own
reference documentation.
<P>
Because of the use of VM protection by the collector,
there are some additional constraints 
on what programs may legally do.  For example, you cannot pass an 
address on the heap as an argument to <TT>sigvec</TT>(2).  These restrictions 
are documented in <TT>RTHeapDepC.c</TT>.
If they seem onerous, we might be able to eliminate some.
Note also that <TT>fork()</TT> and <TT>vfork()</TT> are now
relatively expensive operations, 
since they cause the current collection to finish;
this situation may improve in a future release.
