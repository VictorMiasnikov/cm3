<h2>GNU Emacs support</h2>

<p>CM Modula-3 comes with a mode for editing Modula-3 programs under <tt>gnuemacs</tt>.
The work on the mode is in progress, here we present some documentation
on the current snapshot. Here is a list of the key things this mode provides:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Indenting/pretty-printing </li>

<p>of formatting code, one ``batch'' and one ``interactive.'' The batch
method invokes the program <tt><a href="pprint.html">m3pp</a></tt>, which
takes a program unit such as a procedure and formats it completely. The
<tt>gnuemacs</tt> commands that invoke <tt><a href="pprint.html">m3pp</a></tt>
are <tt>M-x m3::pp-buffer</tt> which pretty prints the current buffer,
<tt>M-x m3::pp-region</tt> which pretty-prints the code between mark and
point, and <tt>M-x m3::pp-unit</tt> which pretty-prints the ``unit'' containing
the cursor. (A unit is a top-level construct such as <tt>CONST</tt>, <tt>TYPE</tt>,
<tt>VAR</tt>, or <tt>PROCEDURE</tt>.) <tt>m3::pp-buffer</tt>, <tt>m3::pp-region</tt>
and <tt>m3::pp-unit</tt> are bound to the keys <tt>C-c b</tt>, <tt>C-c
r</tt> and <tt>C-c u</tt>, respectively. </p>

<p>The other method of formatting text is a more traditional one for <tt>gnuemacs</tt>,
in which there the language mode provides a key that indents the current
line appropriately. In keeping with the convention used in modes for other
languages such as Lisp and C, the key used is <tt>TAB</tt>. Typing <tt>TAB</tt>
on a line indents the current line in a way that is (we hope) appropriate
given the lines that precede it. </p>

<p>The two formatting methods are not mutually exclusive; perhaps you like
the way <tt>m3pp</tt> lines up columns in declarations, but you also like
to keep things indented while you type. You can use the electric mode to
get things close, then invoke <tt><a href="pprint.html">m3pp</a></tt> when
you're done. </p>

<li>Avoidance of typing: </li>

<p>Modula-3 mode offers some aid if you don't like typing a lot of uppercase
keywords. The <tt>TAB</tt> actually serves double duty; it not only indents
the current line, but when invoked at the end of a word, it attempts to
complete the current word as a keyword. For example <tt>b TAB</tt> expands
the <tt>b</tt> to <tt>BEGIN</tt>, provided the <tt>b</tt> appears in a
context where <tt>BEGIN</tt> may be a valid keyword. There are some fairly
extensive rules governing the contexts in which a given keyword is a valid
completion; the net result is that it is seldom necessary to type more
than one letter to get the correct completion. If you specify a non-unique
prefix of a set of keywords, it chooses the first in an ordering intended
to capture frequency of use; it also presents the other choices, and typing
<tt>TAB</tt> repeatedly cycles through these choices. </p>

<p>A pair of related features are ``<tt>END</tt>-completion'' and ``<tt>END</tt>-matching.''
If the elisp variable <tt>m3::electric-end</tt> is set to <tt>'all</tt>,
completing the keyword <tt>END</tt> has the additional effect of finding
the construct that the <tt>END</tt> completes. If that construct is a an
interface, module, or procedure, it fills in the name of the completed
construct after the <tt>END</tt>; otherwise, it inserts a comment containing
the keyword of the completed construct. If <tt>m3::electric-end</tt> is
<tt>'proc-mod</tt>, it only fills in real names, never keyword comments.
Independently, a non-<tt>nil</tt> value of the elisp variable <tt>m3::blink-end-matchers</tt>
causes completion of <tt>END</tt> to blink the cursor briefly at the beginning
of the completed construct. </p>

<li>Finding files. </li>

<p>The key <tt>C-c i</tt> is bound to <tt>m3::show-interface</tt>, which
expects the point to be in an interface name, and attempts to find that
interface and display it in another window. It uses a built-in list of
directories. You may consider changing the default value of this list.
</p>

<p>The key <tt>C-c m</tt> is bound to <tt>m3::show-implementation</tt>.
This attempts to find the module that implements the interface in the current
buffer. As distributed, this function relies on Modula-3 coding conventions.
It may not work for you, in which case it may need to be re-implemented
or abandoned. </p>
</ul>

<p>To have the Modula-3 mode automatically invoked when visiting a Modula-3
source file, you should put in your <tt>.emacs</tt>: </p>

<pre>    (autoload 'modula-3-mode &quot;modula3&quot;)
    (setq auto-mode-alist 
         (append '((&quot;\\.ig$&quot; . modula-3-mode)
                   (&quot;\\.mg$&quot; . modula-3-mode)
                   (&quot;\\.i3$&quot; . modula-3-mode)
                   (&quot;\\.m3$&quot; . modula-3-mode))
                   auto-mode-alist))    
</pre>

<p>It is also convenient to have the lines: </p>

<pre>    (setq completion-ignored-extensions
       (append '(&quot;.mo&quot; &quot;.mx&quot; &quot;.mc&quot; &quot;.io&quot; &quot;.ix&quot;) completion-ignored-extensions))
</pre>

<p>so that you don't get the files with those extensions offered as possible
completions. </p>

<p>Your system administrator may have inserted these lines in the default
macro files for your system. </p>

<h3>Tags</h3>

<p>There is also a program to build tags file for Modula-3 programs: <tt>m3tags</tt>;
see the manpage for the details. When the system is installed, a tag file
for the public interfaces is built. To access it, you need in your <tt>.emacs</tt>
(or in the system initialization file) the line: </p>

<pre>    (visit-tags-table &quot;LIB_USE/FTAGS&quot;)
</pre>

<p>where <tt>LIB_USE</tt> is the place where the Modula-3 libraries have
been installed. </p>
