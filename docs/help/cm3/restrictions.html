<h2>Implementation restrictions</h2>

<p>With a few exceptions, CM Modula-3 implements the Modula-3 language
as defined in ``<a href="../../help/bib.html#SPwM3">Systems Programming with
Modula-3</a>''. </p>

<h3>Arithmetic checking</h3>

<p>CM Modula-3 does not generate any special checking for integer arithmetic
overflow or underflow. You get whatever checking <tt>gcc</tt> gives you.
Depending on your machine, the <tt><a href="../../help/gen_html/m3core/src/float/IEEE-default/FloatMode.i3.html">FloatMode</a></tt>
interface may be used to control floating point exceptions. </p>

<h3>Packed types</h3>

<p>Packed types are restricted. The compiler enforces the rule that every
scalar field (packed or unpacked) can be loaded by a simple ``load, shift,
and mask'' sequence on the machine. So, for example, its not possible to
have a 32-bit integer that crosses a 32-bit alignment boundary on a machine
which only supports aligned 32-bit loads. </p>

<h3>Stack overflow checking</h3>

<p>CM Modula-3 does not reliably detect thread stack overflows. Stacks
are only checked for overflow on procedure entry. No checking is done on
external procedures. Thread stacks are allocated in fixed size chunks.
The required<a href="../../help/gen_html/m3core/src/thread/Common/Thread.i3.html"> <tt>Thread</tt></a> interface has
been augmented with the <tt>SizedClosure</tt> type to allow arbitrary sized
stacks. The default size can be adjusted with <tt>Thread.MinDefaultStackSize</tt>
and <tt>Thread.IncDefaultStackSize</tt>. </p>

<h3>Exception semantics</h3>

<p>On some platforms (<tt>ALPHA_OSF</tt> and <tt>DS3100</tt>), exceptions
scopes are delimited by tables of PCs and exceptions are dispatched by
a runtime routine that's able to unwind the stack. If you can implement
a stack walker for your machine, send us the code. (See <tt>libm3/src/runtime/*/RTExceptionC.c</tt>
for examples.) </p>

<p>On all other platforms, CM Modula-3 uses C's <tt>setjmp</tt>/<tt>longjmp</tt>
mechanism to unwind the stack when raising an exception. A problem can
occur: assignments may appear to be undone. For example, consider </p>

<pre>    TRY
      i := 3;
      P ();
    EXCEPT E:
      j := i;
    END;
</pre>

<p>where <tt>P</tt> raises exception <tt>E</tt>. The compiler generates
a <tt>setjmp</tt> at the beginning of the try statement. If the C compiler
allocates variable <tt>i</tt> to a register, the assignment of <tt>3</tt>
may be lost during the <tt>longjmp</tt> and branch that gets to the handler.
</p>

<h3>Method constants</h3>

<p>The language definition says that if <tt>T</tt> is an object type and
<tt>m</tt> one of its methods, <tt>T.m</tt> denotes the procedure value
that implements that method and that this value is a constant. In CM Modula-3,
<tt>T.m</tt> denotes the correct procedure constant, but since the compiler
generates runtime code to locate the method, some uses of the constant
that the <tt>C</tt> compiler must resolve at link time will cause <tt>C</tt>
errors. For example, </p>

<pre>    CONST P = T.m;  BEGIN P (...) ...
</pre>

<p>will work, since no initialized <tt>C</tt> storage is allocated for
<tt>P</tt>. But the following generates initialized storage and will fail
</p>

<pre>    CONST X = ARRAY [0..2] OF Proc { T.m, ..};
</pre>

<p>Similarly, although Modula-3 allows it, the following cannot be evaluated
at compile time </p>

<pre>    CONST X = (T.m = MyProcedure);
</pre>
