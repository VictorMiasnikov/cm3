<h2>Installing Packages</h2>

<p>The command &quot;<tt>cm3 -ship</tt>&quot;&nbsp;will ship all the build
directories (for different architectural variants) that exist in the package.
It will refuse to ship anything if it finds a variant that was built with
&quot;overrides&quot;, unless the &quot;-k&quot; option is given, in which
case it will ship all the variants except those that were built with overrides.
