<h2>Release history</h2>

<p>Here's a brief description of the releases: </p>

<p><b>Version d5.7.0 </b> CM3-IDE has been added to the release.  
CM3-IDE provides the functionality of the former Reactor(tm) product by Critical Mass.

<p><b>Version 5.1 </b> This is the first <b>open source</b> release of
CM3. Platforms FreeBSD2, FreeBSD3, FreeBSD4, and LINUXLIBC6 have been
added, runtime support for SOLgnu has been updated. Reactor(tm) is not
(yet) included. Support for 64 bit arithmetic has been added, implicit
exceptions, mapping of runtime errors to exceptions, dynamically
loadable CM3 modules, and Unicode support (16 bit characters, type
WIDECHAR). The TextF interface is gone, since TEXTs are now objects
which can hold combinations of 8 and 16 bit characters.

<p><b>Version 4.1 </b> New ports of <tt>cm3</tt> support shared library
on eight platforms. Support for incremental garbage collection is 
available for NT386, ALPHA_OSF, and LINUXELF.
shared libraries on. Reactor(tm) environment is extended to support
large installations.</p>

<p><b>Version 4.0 </b>revamps the basic structure of the builder to allow
dynamic changes in the system. All compiling and building is now done through
<tt>cm3</tt>, an integrated builder/compiler which can be extended via
a quake configuration file, cm3.cfg. Need for m3makefiles for simple programs
is removed. Configurations can change on the fly. It also adds comprehensive
documentation and Reactor(tm)&nbsp;user interface to create an integrated
development environment.</p>

<p><b>Version 3.5.3</b> fixes bugs, includes a working version of the RS6000/AIX
bootstrap and has a version of the HP/PA bootstrap that works with the current
gcc 2.6.3 back-end. Also included in this release is support for PEX-based
3-D graphics and animation. The debugger, m3gdb, can handle floating-point
literals and many more built-in functions. A mostly-working version of Trestle
on Windows is included. </p>

<p><b>Version 3.5.2</b> fixes minor bugs. </p>

<p><b>Version 3.5.1</b> fixes minor installation glitches and includes
a Modula-3 version of m3zume. </p>

<p><b>Version 3.5</b> fixes several minor installation glitches and upgrades
the gcc-based back-end from version 2.5.7 to 2.6.3. This version also includes
untested support for Linux with ELF object files and shared libraries,
support for ``stable objects'', and Sil, an example of native Windows programming
in Modula-3. </p>

<p><b>Version 3.4</b> includes new ports to PCs running Windows/NT or FreeBSD
(1.1.5 or 2.0) and SGI/MIPS boxes running IRIX5.2. The Windows/NT port
does not include Trestle. The driver program, m3, and the first pass of
the compiler were merged into a single process. Hence, the driver maintains
a cache of parsed and type-checked interfaces for the duration of a build.
</p>

<p><b>Version 3.3</b> fixes several bugs in the 3.2 installation scripts.
This release includes <i>Visual Obliq</i>, a system for rapidly prototyping
distributed applications. </p>

<p><b>Version 3.2</b> is mostly bug fixes for 3.1. The new implementations
of <tt>Fmt</tt> and <tt>Lex</tt> are included. A mail and news reading
program, <i>Postcard</i>, is included. A new <!--<a href="../../m3sources/html/COPYRIGHT.html">-->license
agreement/copyright notice<!--</a>--> is attached to this version. The new license
allows commercial use of SRC Modula-3 with very few restrictions. </p>

<p><b>Version 3.1</b> is the first version of the native-code world that
should build and install on some platforms. The following platforms should
work out of the box: <tt>DS3100</tt>, <tt>ALPHA_OSF</tt>, and <tt>LINUX</tt>.
These platforms have had an initial round of bug fixes, but may still have
problems: <tt>SPARC</tt>, <tt>HPPA</tt>, and <tt>IBMR2</tt>. All other
platforms are untested. </p>

<p>A more detailed list of changes includes: </p>

<ul>
<li>The compiler has a new internal interface between the front-end and
the back-end, M3CG. This interface is supposed to be easy to implement.
</li>

<li>The front-end can compute in the target arithmetic system; in particular
it is possible to cross-compile to machines with larger integers than the
host. </li>

<li>One back-end has been implemented on top of gcc. The implementation
of M3CG interface generates the tree representation used internally in
gcc. From the gcc point of view, this back-end looks like a new front-end.
Using this back-end, we have cross-compiled solitaire for mips, alpha and
386 processors; there is no reason to believe that there would be a problem
for the other architectures supported by gcc. </li>

<li>Prof. Dave Hanson from Princeton wrote another implementation of the
M3CG that is self-contained. He is currently working on the 386 code generation
(he has done the mips code generation already). </li>

<li>Gdb has been modified to understand Modula-3 debugging information
produced by the back-ends. gdb can now parse Modula-3 expressions, print
Modula-3 values and evaluate some of the Modula-3 built-in operations.
There is also a little bit of support for multi-threaded programs (you
can look at the stacks of other threads). </li>

<li>There is a replacement for m3make, m3build, that does not rely on cpp/awk/sed/make
and what not, and removes some of the limitations of m3make. m3makefiles
are very similar. </li>

<li>libm3 has been significantly changed by the Interface Police, mostly
in the area of OS interfaces and data structures. </li>

<li>For the OS interfaces, we still have the U* interfaces, but applications
are not supposed to use those. Instead they should use a new set of interfaces
that are os-independent; for example, there is a Pathname interface that
manipulates file names; there is a Process interface that manipulate child
processes. These interfaces enabled a prototype port of the C based version
to Windows NT machines. </li>

<li>For the data structures, generics have been introduced and the various
data structures are more consistent. </li>

<li>Because of m3build and the new OS interfaces, we can think about porting
to OSes other than Unix. In particular a Windows NT port will be available
at some point. </li>

<li>The runtime has been improved quite a bit. </li>

<li>New platforms: Alpha running OSF/1, 386 running Linux. We will pay
more attention to the porting instructions and support. </li>

<li>I am not sure about all the changes in the libraries other than libm3.
I suspect that there will be few changes in trestle, but that mentor changed
quite a bit. </li>

<li>The Windows NT port uses native threads. This should be a good model
for other implementations of Thread using native threads. </li>

<li>Also included are <i>Network Objects</i>, a tool to aid in building
distributed systems, and <i>Obliq</i>, a small statically-scoped, untyped,
object-oriented, higher-order, concurrent, distributed and embeddable language.
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Version 3.0</b> is the first public release of the native-code compiler,
new libraries, a new build tool <tt>m3build</tt>, and full symbolic debugger
<tt>m3gdb</tt>. This release does not build or install properly. It's primarily
intended for brave pioneers and curious browsers. </p>

<p><b>Version 2.11</b> is the first public release of the <tt>FormsVBT</tt>
window toolkit and the <tt>Zeus</tt> animation system. </p>

<p><b>Version 2.10</b> includes a port to the <tt>HP/PA</tt> and <tt>SUN
386i</tt> architectures and many improvements to the <tt>IBM RS/6000</tt>
port. </p>

<p><b>Version 2.0</b> implements the twelve language changes (i.e. generics,
IEEE floating point interfaces, ...) that are included in <a href="../bib.html#SPwM3">SPwM3</a>.
Version stamp checking was moved into the <tt>m3</tt> driver, which also
supports <tt>-make</tt> mode and generates enough type declarations to
make debugging tolerable. The compiler internals were rearranged and many
bugs were removed. Better code is produced. </p>

<p><b>Version 1.6</b> fixes many bugs that have been reported. It also
introduces the <tt>SUN3</tt>, <tt>UMAX</tt> and <tt>ARM</tt> architectures.
Some Unix interfaces have been added or modified (<tt>Usocket</tt>, <tt>Udir</tt>,
<tt>Uexec</tt>, <tt>Uerror</tt>). The names in the <tt>Rd</tt> and <tt>Wr</tt>
interfaces are now more coherent. The new <tt>Pkl</tt> interface allow
input/output of binary data structures. The runtime has been rewritten
to be mostly in Modula-3; this allows for clean interfaces to the runtime;
some limitations have been removed (profiling; scheduling). The driver
has been rewritten, so as to support shared libraries (on <tt>IBMR2</tt>,
by default); the syntax of some options has changed. </p>

<p><b>Version 1.5</b> supports five new architectures (<tt>AP300</tt>,
<tt>AIX386</tt>, <tt>IBMR2</tt>, <tt>IBMRT</tt> and <tt>HP300</tt>). The
driver has been modified to improve portability of user systems. The SRC
Modula-3 libraries have been reorganized, and of course known bugs have
been fixed. New demonstration programs and games are included. </p>

<p><b>Version 1.4</b> is the second public release of SRC Modula-3. It
uses the new features of version 1.3 and was alpha-tested by several SRC
clients. This version added <tt>&lt;*UNUSED*&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;*OBSOLETE*&gt;</tt>
pragmas, simplified coverage profiling by having the compiler directly
generate the counters, reduced the number of <tt>#line</tt> directives
in the generated C, added ``map'' procedures so that the garbage collector
can efficiently locate global references, packed enumerations into smaller
C types, and fixed several bugs. </p>

<p><b>Version 1.3</b> is for internal use only. This version serves to
snapshot the massive editing that has taken place since 1.2. This version
fixed the variable renaming problems, made <tt>TEXT</tt> a <tt>REF ARRAY
OF CHAR</tt>, converted the text implementation to Modula-3, passed nested
procedures as closures, used C initialization where possible for constants
and variables, added warning messages, and fixed many bugs. </p>

<p><b>Version 1.2</b> </p>

<p>Thanks to the new technology introduced in 1.1, porting the compiler
to other machines is much easier. We have ported it to DECstation 3100
running Ultrix 3.1. A few bugs have been fixed. The driver processes the
options <tt>-D</tt> and <tt>-B</tt> in a slightly different way. </p>

<p>The installation procedure is new, and we no longer furnish executables
as the intermediate C files are present on the release. Because the intermediate
C files vary according to the target machine, there are separate <tt>tar</tt>
files for each of the supported machines. However, each distribution contains
all of the sources; only the intermediate C files differ. </p>

<p><b>Version 1.1</b> </p>

<p>This version is for internal use only. The main difference with Version
1.0 is the use of <tt>rcs</tt> and the use of <tt>imake</tt> rather than
the standard <tt>make</tt>. </p>

<p><b>Version 1.0</b> </p>

<p>This version is the first release of the SRC Modula-3 system. It contains
a Modula-3 compiler and runtime, a core library, a coverage analyzer, a
dependency checker, a Modula-3 pretty printer, and a small test suite of
Modula-3 programs. The compiler generates C as an intermediate code. </p>

<p>It is known to run on VAX Ultrix 3.1. We have not tested the software
in any other configurations. The software may function correctly on other
versions of Ultrix, and if recompiled, may even work on other machines.
