<H2>Literate programming</H2>
<P>

The following procedures support literate programming with
Norman Ramsey's "noweb" system.
<P>

<B> noweb(f,r,d) </B>  
          The file <TT>f.nw</TT> is a noweb source file.  The file <TT>d</TT>
          is a Modula-3 source file (including its extension) which should
          be created by extracting from the root <TT>r</TT> in the noweb file.
<P>

<B> Noweb(f,r,d) </B>  
          Similar to <TT>noweb</TT>, but also exports the file <TT>d</TT>
          to <TT>/pub</TT>.
<P>

<B> noweb_doc(f,d) </B>  
          The source file <TT>d/f.nw</TT> is to be processed by notangle
          to produce the TeX source file <TT>f.tex</TT>.  It will be added
          to the makefile dependencies for <TT>doc.dvi</TT>.
