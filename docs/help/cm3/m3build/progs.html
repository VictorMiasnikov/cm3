<h2>Building programs and libraries </h2>

<p><b>library(X) </b>compile the sources accumulated so far and build a
library, <tt>X</tt>, from the resulting compiled object files. The visibility
of the library is hidden. </p>

<p><b>Library(X) </b>The same as <tt>library</tt>. </p>

<p><b>program(X) </b>constructs an executable program named <tt>X</tt>
from the given sources. </p>

<p><b>Program(X) </b>like <tt>program</tt>, but <tt>X</tt> is exported
to <tt>/bin</tt>. </p>

<p><b>build_standalone() </b>ensures that the program being built does
not depend on dynamic linking and shared libraries. To have an effect,
this procedure must be called before <tt>program</tt> or <tt>Program</tt>
is called. </p>
