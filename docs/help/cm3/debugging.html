<h2>Debugging</h2>

<p>Debuggers are not as essential in programming Modula-3 as they are in
C or C++. Nevertheless, it is always good to have a robust debugger around.
There is a debugger available for Modula-3 called m3gdb<!-- available in the
contrib section of the Reactor(tm) CD-->. You must use <a
href="../m3gdb/m3gdb-onepage.html"><tt>m3gdb</tt></a> to debug
code generated by CM Modula-3. It's a version of <tt>gdb</tt> that's been
modified to understand Modula-3 types, declarations, and expressions. These
modifications are quite new, and hence the current release of m3gdb is
unsupported. We hope to provide better debugging support in future releases.
On Win32 platforms, Modula-3 seems to interoperate with the Microsoft Visual
C++ Debugger(tm).</p>

<p><tt>m3gdb</tt> is documented on <a href="../m3gdb/m3gdb-onepage.html">its 
own manual page.</a></p>

<p>The rest of this section provides some hints for using m3gdb. </p>

<p>When it's first started, you must explicitly tell <tt>m3gdb</tt> that
it's working on a Modula-3 program. To do that type </p>

<pre>    (m3gdb) set language m3
</pre>

<p>Similarly, if you need to access <tt>C</tt> procedures or variables
or do some kinds of low-level debugging, type </p>

<pre>    (m3gdb) set language c
</pre>

<h3>Procedures</h3>

<p>Modula-3 procedures are mapped as closely as possible into C procedures.
Two differences exist: ``large'' results and nested procedures. </p>

<p>First, procedures that return structured values (i.e. records, arrays
or sets) take an extra parameter. The last parameter is a pointer to the
memory that will receive the returned result. This parameter was necessary
because some C compilers return structured results by momentarily copying
them into global memory. The global memory scheme works fine until it's
preempted by the Modula-3 thread scheduler. </p>

<p>Second, nested procedures are passed an extra parameter, the ``static
link''. The exact details of how that parameter are passed are system dependent.
</p>

<p><i>I don't know how to call a nested procedure from the debugger's command
line.</i> </p>

<p>When a nested procedure is passed as a parameter, the address of the
corresponding C procedure and its extra parameter are packaged into a small
closure record. The address of this record is actually passed. Any call
through a formal procedure parameter first checks to see whether the parameter
is a closure or not and then makes the appropriate call. Likewise, assignments
of formal procedure parameters to variables perform runtime checks for
closures. </p>

<p><tt><a href="pragmas.html">&lt;*EXTERNAL*&gt;</a></tt> procedures have
no extra parameters. <i>except if they return large results?? </i></p>

<h3>Threads</h3>

<p><tt>m3gdb</tt> provides two commands to assist debugging multi-threaded
programs. The command <b>threads</b> lists the threads that exist in the
program, with the first thread being the most recently active one. The
command <b>switch n</b> switches the current context to the thread identified
as <tt>n</tt> by the <tt>threads</tt> command. If you use the <tt>switch</tt>
command, you <i>must</i> use it again to switch back to the thread that
was interrupted before you can continue the execution of the program (i.e.
the first thread listed by the <tt>threads</tt> command). If the <tt>switch</tt>
command is interrupted, the state of <tt>m3gdb</tt> is essentially random
and it will most likely crash. The current language must be <tt>m3</tt>
for the <tt>threads</tt> and <tt>switch</tt> commands to work. </p>

<p>There is no mechanism to run a single thread while keeping all others
stopped. </p>

<p><a name="GC"></a></p>

<h3>Garbage collection</h3>

<p>Some platforms (eg DS3100 and SPARC) use a VM-synchronized <a href="gc.html">garbage
collector</a>. On those platforms will find it simplest to run it with
the <tt><a href="m3args.html">@M3novm</a></tt> switch. For example, start
your program with </p>

<pre>    (m3gdb) run MyProgram @M3novm
</pre>

<p>If you do not use the <tt><a href="m3args.html">@M3novm</a></tt> flag,
you must set <tt>m3gdb</tt> to ignore VM faults generated on the collector's
behalf, by typing </p>

<pre>    (m3gdb) handle 11 noprint pass
</pre>

<p>But then, without <tt><a href="m3args.html">@M3novm</a></tt>, you might
not be able to examine the heap when the program stops, because the heap
may be protected. You can turn off all current heap protection by telling
<tt>m3gdb</tt> </p>

<pre>    (m3gdb) call RTCollectorSRC.FinishVM()
</pre>

<p>If you also want the collector not to use VM protection in the future
(i.e., if you wish you'd typed <tt><a href="m3args.html">@M3novm</a></tt>
to start with), you can type </p>

<pre>    (m3gdb) call RTCollectorSRC.DisableVM()
</pre>

<p>If your program is not run from the debugger, and it dumps core, the
runtime automatically calls the equivalent of <tt>RTCollectorSRC.FinishVM()</tt>
to let you examine the heap in the core file. </p>
