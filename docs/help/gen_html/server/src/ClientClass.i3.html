  (*
    A ClientClass.T represents an entry of the cvsupd.class configuration
    file and defines the access rights of a client that belongs to a specific
    class. The syntax for an entry looks like this:
    |  classname:\
    |    :collection-dirs=path1,path2,...,pathn:\
    |    :collections=coll1,coll2,coll3,...,colln:\
    |    :opaque-collections=coll1,coll2,coll3,...,colln:\
    |    :branches=pat1,pat2,pat3,...,patn:\
    |    :branches/coll=pat1,pat2,...,patn:\
    |    :tags=pat1,pat2,pat3,...,patn:\
    |    :tags/coll=pat1,pat2,...,patn:\
    |    :maxconnections=n:
    I.E. every entry consists of fields separated by colons; empty fields are
    ignored. A \ as the last character in the line indicates that the entry
    continues with the next line. Lines beginning with # are considered
    comments.

    The first field of an entry is the classname, which is used to identity
    and retrieve an entry. All other entries define name-&gt;value mappings, with
    an equal sign separating name and value. Names may have additional
    specifiers separated by a slash. Values can be arbitrary strings or
    numbers or lists of these elements. Whitespace in values is significant.

    The current version accepts only the following names for mappings:
    collection-dirs, collections, opaque-collections,
    partially-hidden-collections, branches, tags,
    maxconnections. Branches and tags may be followed by an collection
    name and may occur multiple times for different collections.

    The intended semantics are to allow a client belonging to a specified
    class only to access the collections, branches, and tags which are
    specified in its corresponding cvsupd.class entry. Maxconnections defines
    the maximum simultaneous client connections for one class. The values for
    the other elements are regular expressions and used to match against
    concrete values at runtime.
