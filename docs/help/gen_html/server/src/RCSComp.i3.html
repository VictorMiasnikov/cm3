</PRE> A <CODE>RCSComp.T</CODE>, or file differ, is the thread that analyzes the client
   and server versions of each possibly-modified file, and determines
   what changes must be applied to the file on the client side.
<P>
   <CODE>proto</CODE> describes the version of the protcol being used.
<P>
   <CODE>rd</CODE> is the input stream from the client's Detailer.  It provides
   details from the client's version of the file.
<P>
   <CODE>wr</CODE> is the output stream to the client's Updater.  The file differ
   writes edit requests to this stream in order to effect file updates
   on the client.
<P>
   <CODE>compLevel</CODE> is the compression level to be used, for collections that
   have compression enabled.
<P>
   If a <CODE>reaper</CODE> is given, it will be notified just before the thread
   terminates.
