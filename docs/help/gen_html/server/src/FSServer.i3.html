</PRE> An <CODE>FSServer.T</CODE> represents the CVSup server, as a whole.  It receives
   connections on the given <CODE>localEndpoint</CODE>, and forks off subthreads as
   required to service them.
<P>
   <CODE>serverBase</CODE> is the pathname of the base directory for the files
   that describe the collections to be served.  If unspecified, a
   suitable default is used.
<P>
   <CODE>serverCollDirs</CODE> is a colon-separated list of directories where
   the collection information can be found.  Non-absolute paths are
   interpreted relative to <CODE>serverBase</CODE>.  If unspecified, a suitable
   default is used.
<P>
   <CODE>serverScanDir</CODE> is a directory under which the scan files are to be
   found.  If unspecified, then no scan files are used and the server
   does a full tree walk for each collection served.
<P>
   <CODE>loDataPort</CODE> and <CODE>hiDataPort</CODE> specify the range of TCP ports that the
   server will use to establish data connections in passive mode.
<P>
   If <CODE>logger</CODE> is NIL, no logging will be done.
<P>
   <CODE>maxChildren</CODE> governs the number of simultaneous connections that will
   be served.  Friends listed in the configuration file are exempt from
   this limit.  If <CODE>maxChildren</CODE> is less than 0, the server will serve
   one client without forking, and then exit.
<P>
   <CODE>compLevel</CODE> specifies the compression level to be used.  A value
   of 0 gives no compression, while 9 gives the maximum.  The
   default of -1 gives a reasonable default compression level.
