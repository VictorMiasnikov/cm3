<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="SGMLCS.m3.html">SGMLCScanner</A></interface>;
</PRE> This interface defines additional fields and methods for the Scanner
   object defined in the generated SGMLC interface. Since SGML does not
   have a context free syntax, the scanner uses a current state to
   guide the token scanning. Furthermore, a state stack is maintained
   to properly handle nested constructs.
<P>
   Another annoying <CODE>feature</CODE> of SGML is the parameter entities which need
   to be replaced before the parsing may be attempted. Thus, the scanner
   recognizes parameter entities and obtains the replacement text from
   a specified entity resolver. These replacement texts, and external
   files such as Dtd are seen as nested files to be scanned until all
   the input file stack is exhausted. 

<P><PRE>IMPORT <A HREF="SGMLC.i3.html">SGMLC</A>, <A HREF="../../libm3/src/rw/Rd.i3.html">Rd</A>, <A HREF="../../libm3/derived/RefSeq.i3.html">RefSeq</A>;

REVEAL
  SGMLC.Scanner &lt;: PublicScanner;

TYPE
  PublicScanner = SGMLC.PublicS OBJECT
      input: Input;
      inputStack: RefSeq.T;
    METHODS
      initSimple(e: SGMLC.ErrHandler): SGMLC.Scanner;
      setEntityResolver(r: EntityResolver);
      pushState(s: State);
      popState();
      pushFile(name: TEXT; rd: Rd.T);
      pushNextFile(name: TEXT; rd: Rd.T);
      inMarkupDecl(b: BOOLEAN);
    END;
</PRE> Input stores the state for the current file or replacement text, while
   a stack of input states is maintained in case of nested includes or
   parameter entities.
<P>
   The call <CODE>s.initSimple(e)</CODE> initializes <CODE>s</CODE> with <CODE>e</CODE> as error handler.
<P>
   The call <CODE>s.setEntityResolver(r)</CODE> sets <CODE>r</CODE> as the entity resolver from which
   the replacement text may be obtained for parameter entities.
<P>
   The call <CODE>sc.pushState(s)</CODE> pushes <CODE>s</CODE> as the new state for the 
   non-context-free scanning required by SGML.
<P>
   The call <CODE>s.popState()</CODE> returns to the previous scanning state.
<P>
   The call <CODE>s.pushFile(name,rd)</CODE> inserts <CODE>rd</CODE> as a new file named <CODE>name</CODE>
   to read from. Once <CODE>rd</CODE> is exhausted, the scanning resumes where it was.
<P>
   The call <CODE>s.pushNextFile(name,rd)</CODE> adds <CODE>rd</CODE> as a file named <CODE>name</CODE> to
   read from immediately after the current input file is exhausted, before
   resuming with the next input file on the stack.
<P>
   The call <CODE>s.inMarkupDecl(b)</CODE> indicates to the scanner that markup 
   declarations will be processed. 

<P>  <PRE>EntityResolver = OBJECT METHODS
      resolve(name: TEXT): Rd.T;
    END;
</PRE> The entity resolver object decouples the scanner from the higher level
   construct (usually the parser) which finds and stores parameter entities
   and their corresponding replacement text. 

<P>  <PRE>State = { AttValue, EntityValue, PCData, ContentCSect, StartCSect,
      ElementTag, DocType, Element, AttList, Entity, Notation, Catalog };
</PRE> The scanning is slightly different for each of these possible states. 

<P>  <PRE>Input = REF RECORD
      offset: CARDINAL := 0;
      currentLine: CARDINAL := 1;
      currentCol: CARDINAL := 0;
      rd: Rd.T := NIL;
      name: TEXT := &quot;&quot;;
    END;
</PRE> The input structure stores relevant information to determine the exact 
   position in a file, typically for error reporting.
