<P> Type T is an SGML.Application which may be used to print back a parsed
   SGML file to the specified writer. It may be inherited from to perform
   some translation on the parsed file content before printing back.

</PRE> The sgml file corresponding to the received parsing events is printed
   to the writer contained in wr. A stack of elements entered is maintained
   in stack. This may be used to determine the position in the structure
   tree through the use of the size and get methods of the sequence 
   in stack.
