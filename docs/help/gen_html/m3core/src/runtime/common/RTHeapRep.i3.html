<P> <CODE>RTHeapRep</CODE> is a private, implementation-dependent extension to
   <CODE>RTAllocator</CODE>, <CODE>RTCollector</CODE>, and <CODE>RTHeap</CODE>. 

<P><PRE>UNSAFE INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="#x1">RTHeapRep</A></interface>;
</PRE> This interface provides low-level access to the storage allocator and
   garbage collector.  Some items here should be made private or moved
   elsewhere. 

<P><PRE>IMPORT <A HREF="RT0.i3.html">RT0</A>, <A HREF="#x2">RTMachine</A>, <A HREF="../../word/Word.i3.html">Word</A>;
FROM <A HREF="RT0.i3.html">RT0</A> IMPORT Typecode;
</PRE> The allocator and collector maintain two heaps of objects.  One heap is
   <CODE>traced</CODE> (its objects are collected); the other is <CODE>untraced</CODE>.
<P>
   The allocator for the untraced heap is simply <CODE>malloc</CODE>.  Unless
   explicitly noted, all procedures and variables here are for the traced
   heap.  Unless explicitly noted, none of the variables in this interface
   are writable. 

<P>***** PAGES *****

<P> The (traced) heap consists of a number of aligned pages, divided among
   three spaces: Free, Previous, and Current.  All other pages in the
   address space are in the <CODE>Unallocated</CODE> space.  Pages are numbered 0, 1,
   2, ....  The pagesize used is fixed and must be a power of two.
<P>
   The global variable p0 and p1 hold the bounds of the heap pages: only
   pages in the range [p0, p1) are in a space other than Unallocated.  For
   these pages, the array <CODE>desc</CODE> holds more information; desc[p - p0] holds
   state for page <CODE>p</CODE>.

</PRE>***** HEAP OBJECTS *****

<P> An object is a contiguous array of words on the heap.  The first word of
   an object is its header.  The object's body begins at the second word,
   its address is the object's REF.  All object bodies are aligned.
<P>
   <CODE>Small</CODE> objects never cross a page boundary.  <CODE>Large</CODE> objects are larger
   than a page; they span multiple contiguous pages.  For large objects,
   pages following the first are marked <CODE>continued</CODE>.  The large object is
   the only object on its pages; it starts at the beginning of its first
   page, and no other objects follow it on its last page.
<P>
   Special <CODE>filler</CODE> objects are used to exactly fill out the end of a page
   of small objects, or to fill space between small objects when they
   cannot exactly follow the previous object because of alignment
   restrictions.  There are 1-word and multi-word filler objects.  The
   beginning of a page is always adequate alignment, so a filler object
   need never begin a page.

   to dereference <CODE>r</CODE> to copy out data, not including traced references.
<P>
   Although the thread package could use ordinary weak refs, this operation
   is easy to provide and is a little more efficient.  The thread package
   cannot use weak refs straight on public types because its clients should
   remain free to use weak refs on subtypes.
