   <CODE>RuntimeError</CODE> defines the exception raised by the compiler and
   runtime system for the various checked runtime errors defined by
   the language.

EXCEPTION E (T);
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Because <CODE>E</CODE> is implicit, the compiler does not warn about
   where it might occur and the runtime allows it to escape
