<P> RT0u is almost <CODE>the bottom of the world</CODE>.  It contains
   variables that are shared by multiple modules of the runtime
   and/or the compiler and linker.
<P>
   If you're using this interface, you're a wizard!

</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> inCritical provides low-level mutual exclusion between the thread
   runtime, garbage collector and the Unix signal that triggers thread
   preemption.  If inCritical is greater than zero, thread preemption
   is disabled.  We *ASSUME* that <CODE>INC(inCritical)</CODE> and <CODE>DEC(inCritical)</CODE>
   generate code that is atomic with respect to Unix signal delivery. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
