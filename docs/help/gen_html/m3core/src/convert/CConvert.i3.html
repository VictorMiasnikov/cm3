<P> low-level C routines for numeric conversions.

   Index: conversion;  numbers;  ASCII

FROM <A HREF="../C/Common/Ctypes.i3.html">Ctypes</A> IMPORT double, int, int_star, char_star, char_star_star;

&lt;* EXTERNAL m3_strtod *&gt;
PROCEDURE strtod (nptr: ADDRESS; VAR eptr: ADDRESS): LONGREAL;
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Returns a nearest machine number to the input decimal string
   (or sets errno to ERANGE).  With IEEE arithmetic, ties are broken
   by the IEEE round-even rule.  Otherwise ties are broken by biased
   rounding (add half and chop).  </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

&lt;* EXTERNAL m3_dtoa *&gt;
PROCEDURE dtoa (d: double;  mode: int;  ndigits: int;  decpt: int_star;
                sign: int_star;  rve: char_star_star): char_star;
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Converts a C double to an ASCII string. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
</PRE> Arguments ndigits, decpt, sign are similar to those
   of ecvt and fcvt; trailing zeros are suppressed from
   the returned string.  If not null, *rve is set to point
   to the end of the return value.  If d is +-Infinity or NaN,
   then *decpt is set to 9999.
<P>
   mode:
     0 ==&gt; shortest string that yields d when read in
           and rounded to nearest.
     1 ==&gt; like 0, but with Steele &amp; White stopping rule;
           e.g. with IEEE P754 arithmetic , mode 0 gives
           1e23 whereas mode 1 gives 9.999999999999999e22.
     2 ==&gt; max(1,ndigits) significant digits.  This gives a
           return value similar to that of ecvt, except
           that trailing zeros are suppressed.
     3 ==&gt; through ndigits past the decimal point.  This
           gives a return value similar to that from fcvt,
           except that trailing zeros are suppressed, and
           ndigits can be negative.
     4,5 ==&gt; similar to 2 and 3, respectively, but (in
           round-nearest mode) with the tests of mode 0 to
           possibly return a shorter string that rounds to d.
           With IEEE arithmetic and compilation with
           -DHonor_FLT_ROUNDS, modes 4 and 5 behave the same
           as modes 2 and 3 when FLT_ROUNDS != 1.
     6-9 ==&gt; Debugging modes similar to mode - 4:  don't try
           fast floating-point estimate (if applicable).
<P>
     Values of mode other than 0-9 are treated as mode 0.
<P>
     Sufficient space is allocated to the return value
     to hold the suppressed trailing zeros.
