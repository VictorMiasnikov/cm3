</PRE> A <CODE>TreeList.T</CODE> is the thread that traverses the client's directory
   tree, and sends its list of files to the server's Tree Differ.
<P>
   <CODE>proto</CODE> is the descriptor describing the version of the protocol
   that is being used.
<P>
   <CODE>wr</CODE> is the output stream to the Tree Differ.
<P>
   <CODE>collections</CODE> is a sequence of supfile records specifying which
   collections and releases to transfer.
<P>
   <CODE>compLevel</CODE> specifies the compression level to use.
<P>
   If a <CODE>reaper</CODE> is given, it will be notified just before the thread
   terminates.
<P>
   If <CODE>stats</CODE> is specified, the tree lister will maintain various
   statistics in the given object.  It will call the <CODE>start</CODE> method
   initially, then the <CODE>update</CODE> method after each update of the
   statistics, and finally, the <CODE>finish</CODE> method just before terminating. 
<P>
   Debugging information is written to the <CODE>trace</CODE> stream, if specified.
