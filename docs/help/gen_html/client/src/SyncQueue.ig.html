</PRE> A SyncQueue.T, or synchronized queue, is a unidirectional pipeline
   that can be used for inter-thread communication.
<P>
   The <CODE>put</CODE> method appends a new element to the end of the queue.  The
   queue is allowed to grow without bound, so the <CODE>put</CODE> operation never
   blocks the calling thread.
<P>
   The <CODE>get</CODE> method removes and returns the element at the head of the
   queue.  If the queue is empty, <CODE>get</CODE> blocks the calling thread, until
   data is again available to be gotten.
<P>
   Synchronized queues support the notion of an end-of-file marker.  On
   the writing side, the <CODE>close</CODE> method (conceptually) appends an EOF
   mark to the end of the queue.  It is a checked runtime error to call
   <CODE>put</CODE> after <CODE>close</CODE> has been called.  If a <CODE>get</CODE> operation encounters
   the EOF marker, it raises the <CODE>EndOfFile</CODE> exception.  The presence of
   the end-of-file may also be tested explicitly, by the <CODE>EOF</CODE> method.
   Note that, if the queue is empty but it has not been closed, the <CODE>EOF</CODE>
   method will block the calling thread.
<P>
   The <CODE>size</CODE> method can be used to implement non-blocking gets.  It
   returns the number of elements that could be gotten without blocking.
   For the purposes of <CODE>size</CODE>, the end-of-file marker counts as one
   element.
