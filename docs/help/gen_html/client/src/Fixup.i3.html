</PRE> A <CODE>Fixup.T</CODE>, or fixup, holds the information necessary to recover
   from an unsuccessful edit of an RCS file.  If, after editing an RCS
   file, the checksum does not match, then a fixup is generated for that
   file.  The Updater writes the fixups into a synchronized queue
   (see the <CODE>SyncQueue</CODE> generic interface).  These are read later by
   the Detailer.  For each fixup, the Detailer sends a request to the
   server which causes it to send a complete copy of the offending file. 

<P><PRE>END Fixup.
