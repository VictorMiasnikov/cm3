</PRE> A <CODE>BackoffTimer.T</CODE>, or backoff timer, supports timed retries through
   exponential backoff with random jitter. 

<P><PRE>PROCEDURE <A HREF="BackoffTimer.m3.html#New">New</A>(min, max: Time.T;
              backoff: REAL;
	      jitter: REAL): T;
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Creates a new backoff timer with the given parameters. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
</PRE> Disregarding <CODE>jitter</CODE> for a moment, the first retry interval will be
   <CODE>min</CODE>.  Subsequent retry intervals will increase by the factor
   <CODE>backoff</CODE> each time, until <CODE>max</CODE> is reached.
<P>
   <CODE>jitter</CODE> is applied after the above calculation.  It specifies the
   magnitude of the random component relative to the number calculated
   above.  For example, a <CODE>jitter</CODE> of 0.1 will cause the interval to be
   perturbed randomly each time by plus or minus 10 percent. 

<P><PRE>PROCEDURE <A HREF="BackoffTimer.m3.html#Pause">Pause</A>(bt: T);
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Pause until it is time for the next retry. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

PROCEDURE <A HREF="BackoffTimer.m3.html#AlertPause">AlertPause</A>(bt: T) RAISES {Thread.Alerted};
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Like <CODE>Pause</CODE>, but alertable. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

PROCEDURE <A HREF="BackoffTimer.m3.html#Get">Get</A>(bt: T): Time.T;
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Returns the retry interval that will be used the next time <CODE>Pause</CODE> or
   <CODE>AlertPause</CODE> is called. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

END BackoffTimer.
