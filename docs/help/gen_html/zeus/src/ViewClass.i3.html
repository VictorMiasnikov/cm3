 The <CODE>alertable</CODE> field is set by Zeus immediately after a <CODE>View.T</CODE> has
   been instantiated.  Thereafter, the field is read-only.  This field
   indicates whether the view is willing to receive alerts to tell it to
   stop processing the current event. 
 The <CODE>evtHandler</CODE> field is a worker thread tickled by Zeus to process
   each output event when it occurs.  evtCond and evtArg are used in the
   coroutines for output event procesing.
 The <CODE>evtHandled</CODE> field is set to FALSE by the default output event
   methods.  User-provided event handlers will not see this field, and
   hence will not set it.  The event dispatcher uses this field to decide
   whether an event was handled by any view. 
 The <CODE>evtHQuit</CODE> field is used by Zeus to tell the evtHandler thread to
   terminate.
