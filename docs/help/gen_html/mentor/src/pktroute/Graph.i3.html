  (* A &quot;Graph.T&quot; is an undirected graph G = (V, E). In a graph with &quot;n&quot; nodes,
     the nodes are assigned identifiers &quot;[0..(n-1)]&quot;. The type &quot;Graph.T&quot; is
     defined for sub-typing purposes only; graphs are created by instantiating
     one of the subtype implementations below.

     The call &quot;g.newNode()&quot; allocates a new node in &quot;g&quot; and returns the
     identifier of the new node. Identifiers are allocatated sequentially
     starting from 0.

     The call &quot;g.numNodes()&quot; returns the total number of nodes in &quot;g&quot;.

     The call &quot;g.nodeName(id)&quot; returns the name of the node &quot;id&quot; as a text. By
     default, this method simply returns &quot;Fmt.Int(id)&quot;, but clients may wish
     to override this method for graphs with regular topologies. It is an
     unchecked run-time error for &quot;id&quot; not to be in the range
     &quot;[0..g.numNodes()-1]&quot;.

     The call &quot;g.newEdge(id1, id2, wt)&quot; adds an edge in the graph with weight
     &quot;wt&quot; between the node with identifier &quot;id1&quot; and the node with identifier
     &quot;id2&quot;. It is an unchecked run-time error for either &quot;id1&quot; or &quot;id2&quot; not to
     be in the range &quot;[0..g.numNodes()-1]&quot;. It is a checked run-time error for
     &quot;weight &lt; 0.0&quot;.

     The call &quot;g.neighbors(id)&quot; returns an iterator object that can be used to
     enumerate the neighbors of the node &quot;id&quot; in &quot;g&quot; and the weights of the
     connecting edges. *)

  Iterator = ROOT BRANDED OBJECT METHODS
    next(VAR (*OUT*) id: CARDINAL; VAR (*OUT*) weight: REAL): BOOLEAN;
  END;

  (* If &quot;it&quot; is an iterator produced by the call &quot;g.neighbors(id)&quot;, then
     successive calls of the form &quot;it.next(id, weight)&quot; set &quot;id&quot; and &quot;weight&quot;
     to the name of the next neighbor of &quot;id&quot; and the weight of the connecting
     edge, respectively, and return TRUE. If there are no more neighbors,
     &quot;it.next(id, weight)&quot; returns FALSE. In this case, the values of &quot;id&quot; and
     &quot;weight&quot; after the call are undefined. *)

  SparsePublic = T BRANDED OBJECT METHODS
    init(sizeHint: CARDINAL := 10): T
  END;

  (* A &quot;Graph.Sparse&quot; is a graph implemented using an adjacency matrix
     representation. It is intended for sparse graphs, namely those where the
     number of edges is O(V log V), where &quot;V&quot; is the number of nodes in the
     graph.

     &quot;NEW(Graph.Sparse).init(sizeHint)&quot; creates a new sparse graph. The
     &quot;sizeHint&quot; specifies the expected total number of nodes. This is only a
     hint; more nodes than the number specified by the &quot;sizeHint&quot; parameter
     can be added to the graph.

     For a &quot;Graph.Sparse&quot; &quot;g&quot;, the calls &quot;g.asp()&quot; and &quot;g.aswp()&quot; take O((E+V)
     V log V) time and O(V^2) space, where &quot;E&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are the number of edges
     and nodes in &quot;g&quot;. *)

END Graph.
