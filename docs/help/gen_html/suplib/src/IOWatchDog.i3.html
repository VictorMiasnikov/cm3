</PRE> The <CODE>init</CODE> method primes the watchdog timer to call its <CODE>alert</CODE> method
   after the interval <CODE>timeout</CODE> expires.  <CODE>pollInterval</CODE> is the number of
   seconds between polls conducted by the watchdog timer.
<P>
   The default <CODE>alert</CODE> method calls <CODE>Thread.Alert</CODE> on the thread that
   initialized the watchdog timer.
