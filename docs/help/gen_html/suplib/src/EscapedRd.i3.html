<P> The <CODE>EscapedRd</CODE> interface provides a subclass of <CODE>Rd.T</CODE> which
   decodes the record-oriented stream produced by an <CODE>EscapedWr.T</CODE>.  See
   that interface for details of the protocol. 

<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="EscapedRd.m3.html">EscapedRd</A></interface>;

IMPORT <A HREF="../../libm3/src/atom/Atom.i3.html">Atom</A>, <A HREF="../../libm3/src/rw/Rd.i3.html">Rd</A>;

TYPE
  <A HREF="EscapedRd.m3.html#T">T</A> &lt;: Public;

  Public = Rd.T OBJECT METHODS
    init(rd: Rd.T;
	 maxChildRead: CARDINAL := LAST(CARDINAL);
	 closeChild: BOOLEAN := TRUE): T;
  END;
</PRE> The optional parameter <CODE>maxChildRead</CODE> may be used to limit the
   amount of read-ahead done on the child when filling the buffer.
   That sacrifices some efficiency, but it tightens the relationship
   between the number of bytes read from the parent and the number
   of bytes read from the child.  (It is useful when statistics
   are being gathered.)
<P>
   If <CODE>closeChild</CODE> is <CODE>TRUE</CODE> (the default), then closing the escaped
   reader will also cause the child reader to be closed.  If it is
   <CODE>FALSE</CODE>, then the child reader will be left open. 

<P><PRE>VAR (* CONST *)
  InvalidEscape: Atom.T;
  PrematureEOF: Atom.T;
</PRE> If the escaped reader detects a violation of the protocol, it raises
   <CODE>Rd.Failure</CODE> with an error list containing <CODE>InvalidEscape</CODE> or
   <CODE>PrematureEOF</CODE>. 

<P><PRE>END EscapedRd.
