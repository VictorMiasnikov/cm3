<P> The <CODE>MD5</CODE> interface provides facilities for calculating MD5 checksums. 

<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="MD5.m3.html">MD5</A></interface>;

IMPORT <A HREF="MD5Digest.i3.html">MD5Digest</A>, <A HREF="../../libm3/src/os/Common/OSError.i3.html">OSError</A>, <A HREF="../../libm3/src/os/Common/Pathname.i3.html">Pathname</A>;

TYPE
  T = OBJECT METHODS
    clone(): T;
    update(READONLY data: ARRAY OF CHAR);
    updateRaw(data: UNTRACED REF CHAR; count: CARDINAL);
    updateText(text: TEXT);
    finish(): TEXT;
    finishRaw(VAR rslt: MD5Digest.T);
  END;
</PRE> An <CODE>MD5.T</CODE> calculates the MD5 checksum of some data.  After it is
   initialized by the <CODE>init</CODE> method, it may be supplied with data
   in arbitrary chunks, via calls to <CODE>update</CODE> and/or <CODE>updateText</CODE>.
   After all data has been processed, either <CODE>finish</CODE> or <CODE>finishRaw</CODE>
   should be called to retrieve the checksum and free all the
   resources associated with the <CODE>MD5.T</CODE>.  The former returns the
   checksum in text form, as a 32-character string.  The latter
   returns the checksum in raw (binary) form.
<P>
   The <CODE>clone</CODE> method returns a new <CODE>MD5.T</CODE> with an exact copy of the
   state of the existing one. 

<P><PRE>PROCEDURE <A HREF="MD5.m3.html#New">New</A>(): T;
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Creates and initializes a checksum generator, and returns it. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

PROCEDURE <A HREF="MD5.m3.html#NewRCS">NewRCS</A>(): T;
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Creates and initializes a special checksum generator for RCS files.
   It canonicalizes the checksum in such a way as to disregard
   irrelevant differences in white space. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

PROCEDURE <A HREF="MD5.m3.html#FileSignature">FileSignature</A>(name: Pathname.T): TEXT
  RAISES {OSError.E};
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Return the MD5 signature, in text form, of an entire file.  WARNING: The
   MD5 library allocates a buffer of BUFSIZ bytes (from &lt;stdio.h&gt;) on the
   stack, to perform this function.  Take care that the calling thread's
   stack has enough space to allow this. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

END MD5.
