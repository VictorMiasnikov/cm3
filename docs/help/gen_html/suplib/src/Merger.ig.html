<P> <CODE>Merger</CODE> is a generic interface defining an iterator for merging two
   ordered sequences. 

<P><PRE>GENERIC INTERFACE <genericInterface><A HREF="Merger.mg.html">Merger</A></genericInterface>(Elem);
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Where <CODE>Elem.T</CODE> is a reference type and <CODE>Elem</CODE> contains
<P>
<PRE>
      PROCEDURE Compare(a, b: Elem.T): [-1..1];
</PRE>
   <CODE>Compare</CODE> must be a total order.  It may be declared with a
   parameter mode of either <CODE>VALUE</CODE> or <CODE>READONLY</CODE>, but not <CODE>VAR</CODE>.
</EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

TYPE
  <A HREF="Merger.mg.html#T">T</A> &lt;: Public;

  Public = OBJECT METHODS
    next(VAR a, b: Elem.T): BOOLEAN RAISES ANY;

    compare(READONLY a, b: Elem.T): [-1..1];

    getA(): Elem.T RAISES ANY := NIL;
    getB(): Elem.T RAISES ANY := NIL;
  END;
</PRE> A <CODE>Merger.T(Elem)</CODE>, or merger, is an iterator which yields successive
   elements from a merge of two sorted input sequences.  The merger
   gets elements from the two input sequences by calling its methods
   <CODE>m.getA()</CODE> and <CODE>m.getB()</CODE>.  These methods are undefined by
   default, and must be appropriately overridden through subtyping.
   Each method must return the next element of its input sequence,
   or <CODE>NIL</CODE> if the sequence is exhausted.  The elements so returned
   must be ordered as defined by <CODE>m.compare(a, b)</CODE>.
<P>
   The default implementation of <CODE>m.compare(a, b)</CODE> calls
   <CODE>Elem.Compare(a, b)</CODE>.  It may be overridden if desired.
<P>
   The elements of the merged sequence are obtained by calls to
   <CODE>m.next(a, b)</CODE>.  This method returns <CODE>FALSE</CODE> when the merged
   sequence is exhausted; otherwise, it returns <CODE>TRUE</CODE>.  The <CODE>VAR</CODE>
   parameters <CODE>a</CODE> and/or <CODE>b</CODE> are set to the next element of the merged
   sequence, depending on which input sequence it came from.  If the
   elements from the two input sequences are equal according to
   <CODE>m.compare(a, b)</CODE>, then both <CODE>a</CODE> and <CODE>b</CODE> are set.  Otherwise,
   one of them is set to <CODE>NIL</CODE>.
<P>
   The <CODE>RAISES</CODE> set for the <CODE>next</CODE> method is the union of the <CODE>RAISES</CODE>
   sets of <CODE>getA</CODE> and <CODE>getB</CODE>.
<P>
