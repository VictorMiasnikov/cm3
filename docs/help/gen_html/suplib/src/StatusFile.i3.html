</PRE> The <CODE>scanTime</CODE> parameter controls whether the file is opened read-only,
   or for updating.  The default value causes it to be opened read-only.
   If a non-default scan time is specified, the status file is opened in
   update mode, and the given scan time is written into the file header.
   In that case, a separate destination directory can also be specified,
   and it will be prepended to the standard filename for writing the status
   file.  If <CODE>readFromDestDir</CODE> is <CODE>TRUE</CODE>, then the status file will be
   read from the destination directory as well. 

<P><PRE>END StatusFile.
