<P> The <CODE>Reaper</CODE> interface provides facilities for controlling and
   harvesting threads. 

<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="Reaper.m3.html">Reaper</A></interface>;

IMPORT <A HREF="../../m3core/src/thread/Common/Thread.i3.html">Thread</A>;

TYPE
  <A HREF="Reaper.m3.html#T">T</A> &lt;: Public;

  Public = Private OBJECT METHODS
    init(): T;
  END;

  <A HREF="Reaper.m3.html#Private">Private</A> &lt;: ROOT;
</PRE> A <CODE>Reaper.T</CODE> manages a set of threads.  It allows you to fork several
   threads, and then wait until any one of them has terminated.  You do not
   need to know a priori which thread will terminate first.
<P>
   After one of the threads has terminated (or, actually, at any time),
   you can alert all of the remaining threads, for example, to terminate
   all of them prematurely.
<P>
   We say that the threads managed by the reaper are registered with it.
   A thread is registered with the reaper at the time it is forked.  To
   achieve that, use the following procedure to fork the thread, instead
   of <CODE>Thread.Fork</CODE>. 

<P><PRE>PROCEDURE <A HREF="Reaper.m3.html#Fork">Fork</A>(reaper: T; cl: Thread.Closure): Thread.T;
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Fork a thread, and register it with the reaper. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
</PRE> When a registered thread is about to terminate, it should notify its
   reaper via the following procedure. 

<P><PRE>PROCEDURE <A HREF="Reaper.m3.html#Dying">Dying</A>(reaper: T);
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Called by a thread to inform the reaper that it is about to exit. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
</PRE> The following procedures block until the next registered thread has
   terminated.  Then they perform the equivalent of <CODE>Thread.Join</CODE> on the
   terminated thread, and pass back the results. 

<P><PRE>PROCEDURE <A HREF="Reaper.m3.html#JoinNext">JoinNext</A>(reaper: T;
                   VAR thr: Thread.T;
                   VAR ret: REFANY): BOOLEAN;
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> If there are still registered threads that have not died, wait for
   the next one to die.  When that occurs, return <CODE>TRUE</CODE>, passing back
   the thread's handle and return value.  If there are no more registered
   threads alive, return <CODE>FALSE</CODE>. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

PROCEDURE <A HREF="Reaper.m3.html#AlertJoinNext">AlertJoinNext</A>(reaper: T;
                        VAR thr: Thread.T;
                        VAR ret: REFANY): BOOLEAN
  RAISES {Thread.Alerted};
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> An alertable version of <CODE>JoinNext</CODE>. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
</PRE> To alert all registered threads that have not yet terminated, use
   the procedure below. 

<P><PRE>PROCEDURE <A HREF="Reaper.m3.html#AlertAll">AlertAll</A>(reaper: T);
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Alerts all the registered threads that are still alive. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

END Reaper.
