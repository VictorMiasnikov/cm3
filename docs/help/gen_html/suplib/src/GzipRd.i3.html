<P> The <CODE>GzipRd</CODE> interface defines a subclass of <CODE>StreamRd.T</CODE> which reads from
   a compressed stream, decompressing it in the process. 

<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="GzipRd.m3.html">GzipRd</A></interface>;

IMPORT <A HREF="../../libm3/src/os/Common/OSError.i3.html">OSError</A>, <A HREF="../../libm3/src/rw/Rd.i3.html">Rd</A>, <A HREF="../../tcp/src/common/StreamRd.i3.html">StreamRd</A>;

TYPE
  <A HREF="GzipRd.m3.html#T">T</A> &lt;: Public;

  Public = StreamRd.T OBJECT METHODS
    init(rd: Rd.T;
	 maxChildRead: CARDINAL := LAST(CARDINAL);
	 closeChild: BOOLEAN := TRUE): T RAISES {OSError.E};
  END;
</PRE> The <CODE>init</CODE> method is supplied with a so-called child reader, which
   must supply bytes directly from the compressed stream.
<P>
   The optional parameter <CODE>maxChildRead</CODE> may be used to limit the
   amount of read-ahead done on the child when filling the
   decompression buffer.  That sacrifices some efficiency, but it
   tightens the relationship between the number of bytes read from
   the parent and the number of bytes read from the child.  (It is
   useful when statistics are being gathered.)
<P>
   If <CODE>closeChild</CODE> is <CODE>TRUE</CODE> (the default), then closing the Gzip reader
   will also cause the child reader to be closed.  If it is <CODE>FALSE</CODE>, then
   the child reader will be left open. 

<P><PRE>PROCEDURE <A HREF="GzipRd.m3.html#Cleanup">Cleanup</A>(rd: T);
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Frees all resources used by <CODE>rd</CODE>, without doing anything to the child. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
</PRE> <CODE>Cleanup</CODE> is a no-op if the resources have already been freed, e.g.,
   by a call to <CODE>Rd.Close</CODE>. 

<P><PRE>END GzipRd.
