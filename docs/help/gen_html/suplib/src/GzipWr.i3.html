<P> The <CODE>GzipWr</CODE> interface defines a subclass of <CODE>StreamWr.T</CODE> which writes to
   a compressed stream, compressing the data written in the process. 

<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="GzipWr.m3.html">GzipWr</A></interface>;

IMPORT <A HREF="../../libm3/src/os/Common/OSError.i3.html">OSError</A>, <A HREF="../../tcp/src/common/StreamWr.i3.html">StreamWr</A>, <A HREF="../../libm3/src/rw/Wr.i3.html">Wr</A>;

TYPE
  <A HREF="GzipWr.m3.html#T">T</A> &lt;: Public;

  Public = StreamWr.T OBJECT METHODS
    init(wr: Wr.T;
	 level: CompLevel := -1;
	 closeChild: BOOLEAN := TRUE): T RAISES {OSError.E};
  END;

  CompLevel = [-1 .. 9];  (* default, none, fastest .. best *)
</PRE> The <CODE>init</CODE> method is supplied with a so-called child writer, which
   must write bytes directly to the compressed stream.  The optional
   parameter <CODE>level</CODE> specifies the desired tradoff between compression
   efficiency and speed.
<P>
   If <CODE>closeChild</CODE> is <CODE>TRUE</CODE> (the default), then closing the Gzip writer
   will also cause the child writer to be closed.  If it is <CODE>FALSE</CODE>, then
   the child writer will be left open. 

<P><PRE>PROCEDURE <A HREF="GzipWr.m3.html#Cleanup">Cleanup</A>(wr: T);
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Frees all resources used by <CODE>wr</CODE>, without doing anything to the child. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
</PRE> <CODE>Cleanup</CODE> is a no-op if the resources have already been freed, e.g.,
   by a call to <CODE>Wr.Close</CODE>. 

<P><PRE>END GzipWr.
