CONST
  Brand = &quot;RCSEdit&quot;;

  END;
</PRE> An <CODE>RCSEdit.T</CODE> represents a single edit of a file.  It consists of a
   deletion, addition, or replacement (deletion plus addition) of one or
   more consecutive lines of text.  Within an RCS file, each delta
   except the head delta is represented by a sequence of such edits.
<P>
   An edit is applied to an input text, and produces an output text.
   The <CODE>offset</CODE> member is the difference between the input file's line
   number and the output file's line number at the point where the edit
   is applied.  It represents the accumulated effects of the additions
   and deletions effected by the prior edits.  The <CODE>text</CODE> member, if
   non-<CODE>NIL</CODE>, contains one or more lines of text to be added at the
   point of the edit.  It is <CODE>NIL</CODE> for a plain deletion.  

<P><PRE>END RCSEdit.
