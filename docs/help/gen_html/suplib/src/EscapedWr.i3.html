<P> The <CODE>EscapedWr</CODE> interface provides a subclass of <CODE>Wr.T</CODE> which
   supports record-oriented writes to a stream.  All text is passed on
   to the child <CODE>Wr.T</CODE> unchanged, except that a '.' at the beginning of
   a line is doubled.  When the <CODE>EscapedWr.T</CODE> is closed, an end of
   record indication is written to the child.  The end of record is
   <CODE>.\n</CODE> if it follows a newline in the text, or <CODE>\n.+\n</CODE> otherwise. 

<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="EscapedWr.m3.html">EscapedWr</A></interface>;

IMPORT <A HREF="../../libm3/src/rw/Wr.i3.html">Wr</A>;

TYPE
  <A HREF="EscapedWr.m3.html#T">T</A> &lt;: Public;

  Public = Wr.T OBJECT METHODS
    init(wr: Wr.T;
	 closeChild: BOOLEAN := TRUE): T;
  END;

   (* If &quot;closeChild&quot; is &quot;TRUE&quot; (the default), then closing the escaped
   writer will also cause the child writer to be closed.  If it is &quot;FALSE&quot;,
   then the child writer will be left open. *)

END EscapedWr.
