<P> The <CODE>MD5Wr</CODE> interface provides a subclass of <CODE>Wr.T</CODE> which computes
   the MD5 signature of everything it writes. 

<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="MD5Wr.m3.html">MD5Wr</A></interface>;

IMPORT <A HREF="MD5.i3.html">MD5</A>, <A HREF="../../libm3/src/rw/Wr.i3.html">Wr</A>;

TYPE
  <A HREF="MD5Wr.m3.html#T">T</A> &lt;: Public;

  Public = Wr.T OBJECT METHODS
    init(wr: Wr.T;
	 md5: MD5.T := NIL;
	 closeChild: BOOLEAN := TRUE): T;
    getSignature(): TEXT;
  END;
</PRE> If <CODE>closeChild</CODE> is <CODE>TRUE</CODE> (the default), then closing the escaped
   writer will also cause the child writer to be closed.  If it is <CODE>FALSE</CODE>,
   then the child writer will be left open.
<P>
   By default, the signature is computed over exactly the bytes
   that have been written to the MD5 writer.  If the <CODE>md5</CODE> parameter
   is specified, then it can be used to accumulate bytes onto an
   existing partially calculated signature.
<P>
   The <CODE>getSignature</CODE> method may only be called after the <CODE>MD5Wr.T</CODE> has
   been closed.  It returns the text form of the signature. 

<P><PRE>END MD5Wr.
