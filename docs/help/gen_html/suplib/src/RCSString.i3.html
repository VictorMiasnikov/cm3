<P> The <CODE>RCSString</CODE> interface provides an abstract interface to the text
   strings associated with RCS files.  Behind the abstract interface are
   hidden a number of different implementations, each appropriate for a
   different situation.  The goal of this approach is efficiency.
<P>
   For example, most strings that were present in the original RCS file
   are implemented as pointers into the memory-mapped image of the file
   itself.  Thus, those strings can contain huge numbers of characters
   without consuming any memory resources. 

<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="RCSString.m3.html">RCSString</A></interface>;

CONST Brand = &quot;RCSString&quot;;

TYPE
  T = OBJECT METHODS
    toText(): TEXT := NIL;
    numLines(): CARDINAL := NIL;
    iterate(): Iterator := NIL;
  END;

  Iterator = OBJECT METHODS
    next(VAR line: T): BOOLEAN := NIL;
  END;
</PRE> The <CODE>toText</CODE> method returns a <CODE>TEXT</CODE> representation of the entire
   string.  It should be avoided for very large strings.  Instead, the
   <CODE>iterate</CODE> method should be used to access large strings one line at a
   time.
<P>
   The <CODE>numLines</CODE> method returns the number of lines in the string.  If
   the last line does not have a terminating newline character, it still
   counts as a line.
<P>
   The <CODE>iterate</CODE> method constructs an iterator that accesses the
   individual lines of the string in sequence.  Each call to the
   <CODE>Iterator</CODE>'s <CODE>next</CODE> method sets the <CODE>VAR</CODE> parameter to the next
   line of the string, and returns <CODE>TRUE</CODE>.  If there are no more
   lines, <CODE>next</CODE> returns <CODE>FALSE</CODE>.
<P>
   Each returned line includes its terminating newline, if any.  The
   last line won't necessarily end with a newline.
