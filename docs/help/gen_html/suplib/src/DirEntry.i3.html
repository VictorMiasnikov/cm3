<P> A <CODE>DirEntry.T</CODE> represents the information that is returned from reading
   a filesystem directory.  It is split out into a separate interface so
   that it can be used to instantiate generics. 

<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="DirEntry.m3.html">DirEntry</A></interface>;

IMPORT <A HREF="FileAttr.i3.html">FileAttr</A>;

CONST Brand = &quot;DirEntry&quot;;

TYPE
  T = REF RECORD
    name: TEXT;
    attr: FileAttr.T;
  END;

PROCEDURE <A HREF="DirEntry.m3.html#Compare">Compare</A>(READONLY a, b: T): [-1..1];
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Returns <CODE>Text.Compare(a.name, b.name)</CODE>. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

PROCEDURE <A HREF="DirEntry.m3.html#Equal">Equal</A>(READONLY a, b: T): BOOLEAN;
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Returns <CODE>Text.Equal(a.name, b.name)</CODE>. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

END DirEntry.
