<P> The <CODE>CVTree</CODE> interface provides a facility for traversing a CVS
   repository's directory tree.  It incorporates knowledge of the CVS
   Attic into its traversal.  

<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="CVTree.m3.html">CVTree</A></interface>;

IMPORT <A HREF="FileAttr.i3.html">FileAttr</A>, <A HREF="#x1">GlobTree</A>, <A HREF="../../libm3/src/os/Common/Pathname.i3.html">Pathname</A>, <A HREF="../../m3core/src/thread/Common/Thread.i3.html">Thread</A>;

EXCEPTION Error(TEXT);

TYPE
  FileType = {DirDown, File, AtticFile, DirUp};

  Iterator = OBJECT METHODS
    next(VAR type: FileType;
         VAR name: Pathname.T;
         VAR attr: FileAttr.T): BOOLEAN
      RAISES {Error, Thread.Alerted};
    prune();  (* Stop processing entries at this level. *)
    close()
      RAISES {Error, Thread.Alerted};
  END;
</PRE> The <CODE>next</CODE> method of an <CODE>Iterator</CODE> returns <CODE>FALSE</CODE> if the tree
   traversal has completed.  Otherwise, it passes back information about
   the next file in the traversal via the <CODE>VAR</CODE> parameters, and returns
   <CODE>TRUE</CODE>.  The <CODE>type</CODE> parameter is set to indicate the nature of the
   file being processed.  For a regular file, <CODE>type</CODE> is set to
   <CODE>FileType.File</CODE>.  Each directory is processed twice, first when
   descending into it (<CODE>FileType.DirDown</CODE>), and again when ascending
   back out of it (<CODE>FileType.DirUp</CODE>).
<P>
   The <CODE>name</CODE> parameter is set to the pathname of the file, relative to
   the root that was passed to <CODE>Iterate</CODE>.
<P>
   At any point in the traversal, <CODE>prune</CODE> may be called.  That
   terminates the processing of the current directory; no further files
   will be returned from it.  After a call to <CODE>prune</CODE>, the following
   call to <CODE>next</CODE> will return a <CODE>type</CODE> of <CODE>FileType.DirUp</CODE>, ascending
   out of the current directory. 

<P><PRE>PROCEDURE <A HREF="CVTree.m3.html#Iterate">Iterate</A>(root: Pathname.T;
                  follow: GlobTree.T := NIL;
		  attic: GlobTree.T := NIL): Iterator
  RAISES {Error};
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Return an Iterator that will traverse the tree rooted at the given
   directory. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
</PRE> The files within each directory are returned in sorted order by name.
   The sort order is defined by <CODE>Text.Compare</CODE>.
<P>
   The <CODE>follow</CODE> argument specifies a pattern expression.  Symbolic links
   whose names match the pattern will be followed rather than treated
   as links.  The default is equivalent to <CODE>GlobTree.True</CODE>, i.e.,
   follow all links.
<P>
   The <CODE>attic</CODE> argument specifies a pattern expression.  Directories
   whose names match the pattern will be checked for subdirectories
   named <CODE>Attic</CODE> and processed specially.  The default is equivalent
   to <CODE>GlobTree.True</CODE>, i.e., perform Attic processing in all
   directories. 

<P><PRE>END CVTree.
