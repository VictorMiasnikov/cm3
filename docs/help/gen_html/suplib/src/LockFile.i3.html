<P> The <CODE>LockFile</CODE> interface allows one to create and remove lock files.
   It is probably not a good idea to put lock files on NFS-mounted
   file systems. 

<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="LockFile.m3.html">LockFile</A></interface>;

IMPORT <A HREF="../../libm3/src/os/Common/OSError.i3.html">OSError</A>, <A HREF="../../libm3/src/os/Common/Pathname.i3.html">Pathname</A>;

TYPE
  <A HREF="LockFile.m3.html#T">T</A> &lt;: ROOT;

PROCEDURE <A HREF="LockFile.m3.html#Lock">Lock</A>(name: Pathname.T): T
  RAISES {OSError.E};
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Creates and locks a file of the given name.  Returns NIL if it was
   already locked.  Otherwise, writes the current process-ID into the
   file, terminated by a newline.  Returns a handle that can be used to
   unlock the file later.  The file is automatically unlocked and removed
   at process termination. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
