<PRE>INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="POSIX/OSSpecialsPosix.m3.html">OSSpecials</A></interface>;
</PRE> This module contains implementations of miscellaneous functionality that
   need to be different on POSIX, WindowsNT, OS/2, and DOS.

<PRE>PROCEDURE <A HREF="POSIX/OSSpecialsPosix.m3.html#QuotedProcessArgument">QuotedProcessArgument</A>(arg : TEXT) : TEXT;
  (* The brain damaged implementation of Process.Create on Windows NT
     does not preserve the boundaries between different arguments to
     a program. So if one argument contains one or more blanks (or other
     white space), it gets broken up into several arguments. This
     procedure is a workaround for this problem, not the correct
     solution...
