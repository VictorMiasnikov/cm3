<PRE>&lt;*PRAGMA LL*&gt;
</PRE> An <CODE>OffsetVBT.T</CODE> is a filter that maintains a translation
   between the coordinate systems of the child and parent.
   The parent's domain has its northwest corner at an arbitrary
   offset from the child's. The child's domain width and height
   correspond to the child's preferred size.
<P>
   The parent's domain may be a different size than the child's.
   Any portion of the child's domain that isn't visible is
   clipped and any portion of the parent's domain that doesn't
   show a portion of the child, displays in a background color.
<P>
   For <CODE>Simple</CODE>, there is no restriction on the coordinates
   of the northwest corner. For <CODE>T</CODE>, the child's domain has its
   northwest corner at (0, 0); this is used when a child
   is connected to several JoinParent which are viewing the
   same child at several locations on the scree.
<P>
   The child can be <CODE>NIL</CODE>, in which case the <CODE>OffsetVBT</CODE> ignores
   all events.

</PRE> The call <CODE>v.init(ch)</CODE> initializes <CODE>v</CODE> as an <CODE>OffsetVBT</CODE> with
   child <CODE>ch</CODE>.  And the northwest corner of the parent is aligned
   at co-ordinate (<CODE>north</CODE>, <CODE>west</CODE>) mm in the child domain.
<P>
   The call <CODE>v.move(north, west)</CODE> adjusts the co-ordinate system
   so that the <CODE>v</CODE>s northwest corner is positioned at co-ordinate
   (<CODE>north</CODE>, <CODE>west</CODE>) millimeters in the child domain.  This
   offset will be maintained as <CODE>v</CODE> is reshaped or rescreened.
