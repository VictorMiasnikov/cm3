<P> subclass of JVBuffer which uses a Jvs.T to allocate shared memory
   buffers 

<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="generic/JvsBuffer.m3.html">JvsBuffer</A></interface>;

</PRE> This is where we allocate shared memory buffers.  It turns out that the
   jvdriver doesn't deallocate them, so we should keep the ones we have on
   a free list.  In addition, there are only two sizes of shared memory
   buffer allocated: small (for compressed images) and large (for
   decompressed images).  Note that the shared memory images last as long
   as the connection to the server which was used to create them, so do not
   break the connection while still using the memory buffers.
