<P> The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol for
   sending data packets (or {\em datagrams}) over the internet. UDP runs
   on top of the Internet Protocol (IP). It provides a simple datagram
   service that guarantees the integrity of delivered packets. However,
   unlike the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which also runs on
   IP, UDP does not guarantee reliable delivery of packets: packets may
   be dropped or duplicated, and any corrupted packets are simply
   discarded. Nor does UDP provide any sequencing guarantees.
<P>
   Like TCP, each UDP endpoint is identified by the IP address of a host
   together with a port number (see the IP interface for a description
   of IP endpoints). Hence, datagrams may be addressed to different
   processes (listening on different ports) that are running on the same
   host.
<P>
   The complete UDP protocol is documented in Internet RFC 768
   \cite{RFC-768}.


<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="../POSIX/UDPPosix.m3.html">UDP</A></interface>;

TYPE
  Datagram = RECORD
    other: IP.Endpoint;
    len: CARDINAL;
    bytes: REF ARRAY OF CHAR;
  END;
</PRE> A <CODE>UDP.Datagram</CODE> represents a packet of data. If <CODE>d</CODE> is a <CODE>Datagram</CODE>,
   then <CODE>d.other</CODE> is the IP endpoint to which the packet will be sent, or
   from which it was received, <CODE>d.len</CODE> is the length of the packet, and
   <CODE>d.bytes</CODE> contains the packet contents. A valid packet has <CODE>d.bytes # NIL</CODE>
   and <CODE>d.len &lt;= NUMBER(d.bytes^)</CODE>, in which case the bytes of the packet
   are in <CODE>d.bytes[0..(d.len-1)]</CODE>. 

<P><PRE>EXCEPTION Timeout;
</PRE> The <CODE>Timeout</CODE> exception may be raised to indicate a timeout on a blocking
   UDP operation. The UDP implementation may also raise the <CODE>IP.Error</CODE>
   exception; arguments to this exception will be one of the predefined
   values <CODE>IP.NoResources</CODE> or <CODE>IP.PortBusy</CODE>, or a message indicating that
   an unexpected error occured. 

<P><PRE>TYPE

  Public = OBJECT METHODS
    init(myPort: IP.Port; myAddr := IP.NullAddress): T

  END;

END UDP.
</PRE> A <CODE>UDP.T</CODE> is a handle on a socket for receiving datagrams on a particular
   port.
<P>
   The expression <CODE>NEW(UDP.T).init(myPort)</CODE> evaluates to a new UDP handle for
   listening on port <CODE>myPort</CODE>. If the program is being run on a machine with
   multiple IP addresses, an <CODE>IP.Address</CODE> argument can also be passed in
   the optional <CODE>myAddr</CODE> parameter to indicate which network interface will
   be used by this handle to send and receive datagrams.
<P>
   If a UDP handle is closed using the <CODE>close</CODE> method, the <CODE>init</CODE> method can
   be called again to initialize the handle on a different port/address. All
   methods of a <CODE>UDP.T</CODE> other than <CODE>init</CODE> require that the UDP handle has been
   initialized; <CODE>init</CODE> requires that the handle is new or closed.
<P>
   The descriptions of the remaining methods assume that <CODE>udp</CODE> denotes an
   initialized <CODE>UDP.T</CODE>.
<P>
   The call <CODE>udp.send(d)</CODE> sends the datagram <CODE>d</CODE>, returning the number of
   bytes that were successfully sent.
<P>
   The call <CODE>udp.sendText(other, t)</CODE> sends the contents of the text <CODE>t</CODE>
   to the endpoint <CODE>other</CODE>, returning the number of characters of <CODE>t</CODE> that
   were successfully sent.
<P>
   The call <CODE>udp.receive(d)</CODE> blocks until a datagram is sent to <CODE>udp</CODE>'s
   port/address. On entry, <CODE>d.bytes</CODE> should point to an array of characters
   large enough to contain incoming datagrams. On exit, <CODE>d.other</CODE> is set to
   the endpoint from which the datagram was sent, <CODE>d.len</CODE> is set to the length
   of the received datagram, and the contents of the datagram are written into
   <CODE>d.bytes[0..(d.len)-1]</CODE>. If the packet that was received is larger than the
   initial value of <CODE>d.len</CODE>, the packet is truncated to <CODE>d.len</CODE> bytes.
<P>
   If a non-negative value is supplied for <CODE>timeout</CODE>, the method will raise
   <CODE>Timeout</CODE> if <CODE>timeout</CODE> seconds elapse without a packet being received.
   Negative values of <CODE>timeout</CODE> indicate an indefinite wait. If the calling
   thread is alerted before a packet is received, <CODE>Thread.Alerted</CODE> is thrown.
<P>
   The call <CODE>udp.close</CODE> closes <CODE>udp</CODE>. Invoking any methods other than <CODE>init</CODE>
   on a closed handle results in a checked run-time error.
