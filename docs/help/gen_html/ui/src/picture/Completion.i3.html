</PRE> a Completion is a mechanism for notifying the caller when an Image has
   been processed.  Each user of the image should increment the Completion
   when it starts using the image and decrement when it has finished.  When
   the count returns to 0, if /freeProc/ # NIL then the Completion.T will
   be put on a queue for /freeProc/ to be called and those threads blocked
   in /waitUntilFree/ to be signalled to continue.  /Dispose/ will be
   called on the T after /freeProc/ has returned.  If /freeProc/ = NIL,
   then the threads blocked in /waitForFree/ will be signalled
   immediately
