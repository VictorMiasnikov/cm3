<P>
Dividing a computation into concurrent processes (or threads of control) is a
fundamental method of separating concerns.  For example, suppose you are
programming a terminal emulator with a blinking cursor: the most satisfactory
way to separate the cursor blinking code from the rest of the program is to
make it a separate thread.  Or suppose you are augmenting a program with a new
module that communicates over a buffered channel.  Without threads, the rest
of the program will be blocked whenever the new module blocks on its buffer,
and conversely, the new module will be unable to service the buffer whenever
any other part of the program blocks.  If this is unacceptable (as it almost
always is) there is no way to add the new module without finding and modifying
every statement of the program that might block.  These modifications destroy
the structure of the program by introducing undesirable dependencies between
what would otherwise be independent modules.

<P>
The provisions for threads in Modula-2 are weak, amounting essentially to
coroutines.  Hoare's monitors [Hoare] are a sounder basis for concurrent
programming.  Monitors were used in Mesa, where they worked well; except that
the requirement that a monitored data structure be an entire module was
irksome.  For example, it is often useful for a monitored data structure to be
an object instead of a module.  Mesa relaxed this requirement, made a slight
change in the details of the semantics of Hoare's <code>Signal</code> primitive, and
introduced the <code>Broadcast</code> primitive as a convenience [Lampson].  The Mesa
primitives were simplified in the Modula-2+ design, and the result was
successful enough to be incorporated with no substantial changes in Modula-3.

<P>
A threads package is a tool with a very sharp edge.  A common programming
error is to access a shared variable without obtaining the necessary lock.
This introduces a race condition that can lie dormant throughout testing and
strike after the program is shipped.  Theoretical work on process algebra has
raised hopes that the rendezvous model of concurrency may be safer than the
shared memory model, but the experience with Ada, which adopted the
rendezvous, lends at best equivocal support for this hope--Ada still allows
shared variables, and apparently they are widely used.
