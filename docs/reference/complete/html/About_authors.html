<P>
Luca Cardelli was an undergraduate in Pisa and has a Ph.D. in Computer
Science from the University of Edinburgh (1982).  He worked at AT&amp;T Bell
Labs, Murray Hill, from 1982 to 1985 before assuming his current position at
DEC SRC.  His main interests are in constructive logic, type theory, and
language design and implementation.

<P>
Jim Donahue received his Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of
Toronto (1975).  He was an Assistant Professor at Cornell University from 1975
to 1981.  In 1981, he joined the Computer Science Laboratory of the Xerox Palo
Alto Research Center.  In 1986, he established the Olivetti Research Center
and was its Director until 1990.  He is now a Senior Scientist and Product
Manager for Teknekron Software Systems.  His interests include programming
language design, distributed system design, and database systems and
applications.

<P>
Lucille Glassman is a technical writer for DEC SRC.

<P>
Mick Jordan has a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge.
From 1984 to 1988 he worked at the Acorn Research Center in Palo Alto on a
programming environment for Modula-2+.  Before joining DEC SRC in 1990 he was
at Olivetti Research, where he led the group that produced the Olivetti
Modula-3 implementation.  His principal current interest is in programming
tools that are based on Modula-3 Abstract Syntax Trees.

<P>
Bill Kalsow received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of
Wisconsin at Madison (1986).  Since then he has worked as DEC SRC.  His
primary interests are programming languages and their implementations.

<P>
Greg Nelson got his Ph.D. from Stanford in 1980, where he worked on program
verification and algorithms for mechanical theorem proving.  He was the author
of the Juno constraint-based graphics system at Xerox PARC's Computer Science
Laboratory, has taught at Princeton University, and is now a member of DEC
SRC.  Currently his active interests are window systems, programming language
design, and the semantic theory of guarded commands.
