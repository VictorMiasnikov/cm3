<P>
A language feature is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">unsafe</SPAN> if its misuse can corrupt the runtime
system so that further execution of the program is not faithful to the
language semantics.  An example of an unsafe feature is array assignment
without bounds checking: if the index is out of bounds, then an arbitrary
location can be clobbered and the address space can become fatally corrupted.
An error in a safe program can cause the computation to abort with a run-time
error message or to give the wrong answer, but it can't cause the computation
to crash in a rubble of bits.

<P>
Safe programs can share the same address space, each safe from corruption by
errors in the others.  To get similar protection for unsafe programs requires
placing them in separate address spaces.  As large address spaces become
available, and programmers use them to produce tightly-coupled applications,
safety becomes more and more important.

<P>
Unfortunately, it is generally impossible to program the lowest levels of a
system with complete safety.  Neither the compiler nor the runtime system can
check the validity of a bus address for an I/O controller, nor can they limit
the ensuing havoc if it is invalid.  This presents the language designer with
a dilemma.  If he holds out for safety, then low level code will have to be
programmed in another language.  But if he adopts unsafe features, then his
safety guarantee becomes void everywhere.

<P>
The languages of the BCPL family are full of unsafe features; the languages of
the Lisp family generally have none (or none that are documented).  In this
area Modula-3 follows the lead of Cedar by adopting a small number of unsafe
features that are allowed only in modules explicitly labeled unsafe.  In a
safe module, the compiler prevents any errors that could corrupt the runtime
system; in an unsafe module, it is the programmer's responsibility to avoid
them.
