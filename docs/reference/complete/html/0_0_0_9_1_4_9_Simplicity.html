<P>
In the early days of the Ada project, a general in the Ada Program Office
opined that ``obviously the Department of Defense is not interested in an
artificially simplified language such as Pascal''.  Modula-3 represents the
opposite point of view.  We used every artifice that we could find or invent
to make the language simple.

<P>
C.A.R. Hoare has suggested that as a rule of thumb a language is too
complicated if it can't be described precisely and readably in fifty pages.
The Modula-3 committee elevated this to a design principle: we gave ourselves
a ``complexity budget'' of fifty pages, and chose the most useful features
that we could accommodate within this budget.  In the end, we were over budget
by six lines plus the syntax equations.  This policy is a bit arbitrary, but
there are so many good ideas in programming language design that some kind of
arbitrary budget seems necessary to keep a language from getting too
complicated.

<P>
In retrospect, the features that made the cut were directed toward two main
goals.  Interfaces, objects, generics, and threads provide fundamental
patterns of abstraction that help to structure large programs.  The isolation
of unsafe code, garbage collection, and exceptions help make programs safer
and more robust.  Of the techniques that we used to keep the language
internally consistent, the most important was the definition of a clean type
system based on a subtype relation.  There is no special novelty in any one of
these features individually, but there is simplicity and power in their
combination.
