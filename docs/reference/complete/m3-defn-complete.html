Modula-3 was designed by Luca Cardelli, Jim Donahue, Mick Jordan, Bill Kalsow,
and Greg Nelson, as a joint project by the Digital Equipment Corporation
Systems Research Center and the Olivetti Research Center.  Paul Rovner made
many contributions as a founding member of the design committee.  The language
specification was written by Lucille Glassman and Greg Nelson, under the
watchful supervision of the whole committee.

<P>
Maurice Wilkes had the inspiration that sparked the project.

<P>
Our technical starting point was Modula-2+, which was designed by Paul Rovner,
Roy Levin, John Wick, Andrew Birrell, Butler Lampson, and Garret Swart.  We
made good use of the ruthlessly complete description of Modula-2+ in
Mary-Claire van Leunen's <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Modula-2+ User's Manual</SPAN>.  The ideas in the
``+'' part of Modula-2+ were mostly derived from the Mesa and Cedar languages
developed at Xerox PARC.

<P>
Niklaus Wirth designed Modula-2, the starting point of our starting point.  He
also reviewed the evolving design and made many valuable suggestions--not one
of which was a suggested addition.  Indeed, he inspired us with the courage to
pull out a number of deep-rooted weeds.

<P>
SRC Modula-3 was implemented by Bill Kalsow and Eric Muller.  Olivetti
Modula-3 was implemented by Mick Jordan, Trevor Morris, David Chase, Steve
Glassman, and Marion Sturtevant.

<P>
The language and book were greatly improved by the helpful feedback from Bob
Ayers, Andrew Black, Regis Crelier, Dan Craft, Hans Eberle, John Ellis, Stu
Feldman, Michel Gangnet, Lucille Glassman, David Goldberg, Stephen Harrison,
Sam Harbison, Jim Horning, Solange Karsenty, Mike Kupfer, Butler Lampson, Mark
Manasse, Tim Mann, Eliot Moss, Dick Orgass, Sharon Perl, Norman Ramsey, Lyle
Ramshaw, Eric Roberts, Peter Robinson, Ed Satterthwaite, Jorge Stolfi, Garret
Swart, Chuck Thacker, and Ken Zadeck.

1.1 History</A>
</H3>

<P>
On November 6th, 1986, Maurice Wilkes wrote to Niklaus Wirth proposing that
the Modula-2+ language be revised and standardized as a successor to Modula-2.
Wirth gave this project his blessing, and the Modula-3 committee was born.

<P>
At the first meeting, the committee unanimously agreed to be true to the
spirit of Modula-2 by selecting simple, safe, proven features rather than
experimenting with our own untried ideas.  We found that unanimity was harder
to achieve when we got to the details.

<P>
Modula-3 supports interfaces, objects, generics, lightweight threads of
control, the isolation of unsafe code, garbage collection, exceptions, and
subtyping.  Some of the more problematical features of Modula-2 have been
removed, like variant records and the built-in unsigned numeric data type.
Modula-3 is substantially simpler than other languages with comparable power.

<P>
Modula-3 is closely based on Modula-2+, which was designed at the Digital
Equipment Corporation Systems Research Center and used to build the Topaz
system [McJones89, Rovner86].  The Modula-3 design was a joint project by
Digital and Olivetti.  The language definition was published in August 1988,
and immediately followed by implementation efforts at both companies.  In
January 1989, the committee revised the language to reflect the experiences of
these implementation teams.  A few final revisions were made for the
publication of this book.

<P>
SRC Modula-3 is distributed by the DEC Systems Research Center under a liberal
license.  The distribution includes a compiler for Modula-3, the Modula-3
Abstract Syntax Tree toolkit developed at Olivetti, and a runtime system with
configuration files for DEC, IBM, HP, and Sun workstations.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00013200000000000000">
1.2 Perspective</A>
</H3>

<P>
Most systems programming today is done in the BCPL family of languages, which
includes B, Bliss, and C.  The beauty of these languages is the modest cost
with which they were able to take a great leap forward from assembly language.
To fully appreciate them, you must consider the engineering constraints of
machines in the 1960s.  What language designed in the 1980s has a compiler
that fits into four thousand 18-bit words, like Ken Thompson's B compiler for
the PDP-7? The most successful of these languages was C, which by the early
1970s had almost completely displaced assembly language in the Unix system.

<P>
The BCPL-like languages are easy to implement efficiently for the same reason
they are attractive to skeptical assembly language programmers: they present a
programming model that is close to the target machine.  Pointers are
identified with arrays, and address arithmetic is ubiquitous.  Unfortunately,
this low-level programming model is inherently dangerous.  Many errors are as
disastrous as they would be in machine language.  The type system is scanty,
and reveals enough quirks of the target machine that even experienced and
disciplined programmers sometimes write unportable code simply by accident.
The most modern language in this family, C++, has enriched C by adding
objects; but it has also given up C's best virtue--simplicity--without
relieving C's worst drawback--its low-level programming model.

<P>
At the other extreme are languages like Lisp, ML, Smalltalk, and CLU, whose
programming models originate from mathematics.  Lisp is the hybrid of the
lambda calculus and the theory of a pairing function; ML stems from
polymorphic type theory; Smalltalk from a theory of objects and inheritance;
CLU from a theory of abstract data types.  These languages have beautiful
programming models, but they tend to be difficult to implement efficiently,
because the uniform treatment of values in the programming model invites a
runtime system in which values are uniformly represented by pointers.  If the
implementer doesn't take steps to avoid it, as simple a statement as
<code>n := n + 1</code> could require an allocation, a method lookup, or both.  Good
implementations avoid most of the cost, and languages in this family have been
used successfully for systems programming.  But their general disposition
towards heap allocation rather than stack allocation remains, and they have
not become popular with systems programmers.  The runtime systems required to
make these languages efficient often isolate them in closed environments that
cannot accommodate programs written in other languages.  If you are a fan of
these languages you may find Modula-3 overly pragmatic; but read on anyway,
and give us a chance to show that pragmatic constraints do not exclude
attractive solutions.

<P>
Between the extremes of BCPL and Lisp is the Algol family of languages, whose
modern representatives include Pascal, Ada, Modula-2, and Modula-3.  These
languages have programming models that reflect the engineering constraints of
random-access machines but conceal the details of any particular machine.
They give up the beauty and mathematical symmetry of the Lisp family in order
to make efficient implementations possible without special tricks; they also
have strong type systems that avoid most of the dangerous and
machine-dependent features of the BCPL family.

<P>
In the 1960s, the trend in the Algol family was toward features for control
flow and data structuring.  In the 1970s, the trend was toward
information-hiding features like interfaces, opaque types, and generics.  More
recently, the trend in the Algol family has been to adopt a careful selection
of techniques from the Lisp and BCPL families.  This trend is demonstrated by
Modula-3, Oberon, and Cedar, to name three languages that have floated
portable implementations in the last few years.

<P>
Modula-3, Oberon, and Cedar all provide garbage collection, previously viewed
as a luxury available only in the closed runtime systems of the Lisp family.
But the world is starting to understand that garbage collection is the only
way to achieve an adequate level of safety, and that modern garbage collectors
can work in open runtime environments.

<P>
At the same time, these three languages allow a small set of unsafe,
machine-dependent operations of the sort usually associated with the BCPL
family.  In Modula-3, unsafe operations are allowed only in modules explicitly
labeled unsafe.  The combination of garbage collection with the explicit
isolation of unsafe features produces a language suitable for programming
entire systems from the highest-level applications down to the lowest-level
device drivers.

1.4 Features</A>
</H3>

<P>
The remainder of the introduction is an overview of the most important
features of Modula-3.

<P>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> 1.4.1 Interfaces.</A>
</H4>

<P>
One of Modula-2's most successful features is the provision for explicit
interfaces between modules.  Interfaces are retained with essentially no
changes in Modula-3.  An interface to a module is a collection of declarations
that reveal the public parts of a module; things in the module that are not
declared in the interface are private.  A module <SPAN  CLASS="textit">imports</SPAN> the interfaces
it depends on and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">exports</SPAN> the interface (or, in Modula-3, the
interfaces) that it implements.

<P>
Interfaces make separate compilation type-safe; but it does them an injustice
to look at them in such a limited way.  Interfaces make it possible to think
about large systems without holding the whole system in your head at once.

<P>
Programmers who have never used Modula-style interfaces tend to underestimate
them, observing, for example, that anything that can be done with interfaces
can also be done with C-style include files.  This misses the point: many
things can be done with include files that cannot be done with interfaces.
For example, the meaning of an include file can be changed by defining macros
in the environment into which it is included.  Include files tempt programmers
into shortcuts across abstraction boundaries.  To keep large programs well
structured, you either need super-human will power, or proper language support
for interfaces.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00013420000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> 1.4.2 Objects.</A>
</H4>

<P>
The better we understand our programs, the bigger the building blocks we use
to structure them.  After the instruction came the statement, after the
statement came the procedure, after the procedure came the interface.  The
next step seems to be the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">abstract type</SPAN>.

<P>
At the theoretical level, an abstract type is a type defined by the
specifications of its operations instead of by the representation of its data.
As realized in modern programming languages, a value of an abstract type is
represented by an ``object'' whose operations are implemented by a suite of
procedure values called the object's ``methods''.  A new object type can be
defined as a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">subtype</SPAN> of an existing type, in which case the new type
has all the methods of the old type, and possibly new ones as well
(inheritance).  The new type can provide new implementations for the old
methods (overriding).

<P>
Objects were invented in the mid-sixties by the farsighted designers of Simula
[Birtwistle].  Objects in Modula-3 are very much like objects in Simula: they
are always references, they have both data fields and methods, and they have
single inheritance but not multiple inheritance.

<P>
Small examples are often used to get across the basic idea: truck as a subtype
of vehicle; rectangle as a subtype of polygon.  Modula-3 aims at larger
systems that illustrate how object types provide structure for large programs.
In Modula-3 the main design effort is concentrated into specifying the
properties of a single abstract type--a stream of characters, a window on the
screen.  Then dozens of interfaces and modules are coded that provide useful
subtypes of the central abstraction.  The abstract type provides the blueprint
for a whole family of interfaces and modules.  If the central abstraction is
well-designed then useful subtypes can be produced easily, and the original
design cost will be repaid with interest.

<P>
The combination of object types with Modula-2 opaque types produces something
new: the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">partially opaque type</SPAN>, where some of an object's fields are
visible in a scope and others are hidden.  Because the committee had no
experience with partially opaque types, the first version of Modula-3
restricted them severely; but after a year of experience it was clear that
they were a good thing, and the language was revised to remove the
restrictions.

<P>
It is possible to use object-oriented techniques even in languages that were
not designed to support them, by explicitly allocating the data records and
method suites.  This approach works reasonably smoothly when there are no
subtypes; however it is through subtyping that object-oriented techniques
offer the most leverage.  The approach works badly when subtyping is needed:
either you allocate the data records for the different parts of the object
individually (which is expensive and notationally cumbersome) or you must rely
on unchecked type transfers, which is unsafe.  Whichever approach is taken,
the subtype relations are all in the programmer's head: only with an
object-oriented language is it possible to get object-oriented static
typechecking.

<P>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> 1.4.3 Generics.</A>
</H4>

<P>
A generic module is a template in which some of the imported interfaces are
regarded as formal parameters, to be bound to actual interfaces when the
generic is instantiated.  For example, a generic hash table module could be
instantiated to produce tables of integers, tables of text strings, or tables
of any desired type.  The different generic instances are compiled
independently: the source program is reused, but the compiled code will
generally be different for different instances.

<P>
To keep Modula-3 generics simple, they are confined to the module level:
generic procedures and types do not exist in isolation, and generic parameters
must be entire interfaces.

<P>
In the same spirit of simplicity, there is no separate typechecking associated
with generics.  Implementations are expected to expand the generic and
typecheck the result.  The alternative would be to invent a polymorphic type
system flexible enough to express the constraints on the parameter interfaces
that are necessary in order for the generic body to compile.  This has been
achieved for ML and CLU, but it has not yet been achieved satisfactorily in
the Algol family of languages, where the type systems are less uniform.  (The
rules associated with Ada generics are too complicated for our taste.)

<P>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> 1.4.4 Threads.</A>
</H4>

<P>
Dividing a computation into concurrent processes (or threads of control) is a
fundamental method of separating concerns.  For example, suppose you are
programming a terminal emulator with a blinking cursor: the most satisfactory
way to separate the cursor blinking code from the rest of the program is to
make it a separate thread.  Or suppose you are augmenting a program with a new
module that communicates over a buffered channel.  Without threads, the rest
of the program will be blocked whenever the new module blocks on its buffer,
and conversely, the new module will be unable to service the buffer whenever
any other part of the program blocks.  If this is unacceptable (as it almost
always is) there is no way to add the new module without finding and modifying
every statement of the program that might block.  These modifications destroy
the structure of the program by introducing undesirable dependencies between
what would otherwise be independent modules.

<P>
The provisions for threads in Modula-2 are weak, amounting essentially to
coroutines.  Hoare's monitors [Hoare] are a sounder basis for concurrent
programming.  Monitors were used in Mesa, where they worked well; except that
the requirement that a monitored data structure be an entire module was
irksome.  For example, it is often useful for a monitored data structure to be
an object instead of a module.  Mesa relaxed this requirement, made a slight
change in the details of the semantics of Hoare's <code>Signal</code> primitive, and
introduced the <code>Broadcast</code> primitive as a convenience [Lampson].  The Mesa
primitives were simplified in the Modula-2+ design, and the result was
successful enough to be incorporated with no substantial changes in Modula-3.

<P>
A threads package is a tool with a very sharp edge.  A common programming
error is to access a shared variable without obtaining the necessary lock.
This introduces a race condition that can lie dormant throughout testing and
strike after the program is shipped.  Theoretical work on process algebra has
raised hopes that the rendezvous model of concurrency may be safer than the
shared memory model, but the experience with Ada, which adopted the
rendezvous, lends at best equivocal support for this hope--Ada still allows
shared variables, and apparently they are widely used.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00013450000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> 1.4.5 Safety.</A>
</H4>

<P>
A language feature is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">unsafe</SPAN> if its misuse can corrupt the runtime
system so that further execution of the program is not faithful to the
language semantics.  An example of an unsafe feature is array assignment
without bounds checking: if the index is out of bounds, then an arbitrary
location can be clobbered and the address space can become fatally corrupted.
An error in a safe program can cause the computation to abort with a run-time
error message or to give the wrong answer, but it can't cause the computation
to crash in a rubble of bits.

<P>
Safe programs can share the same address space, each safe from corruption by
errors in the others.  To get similar protection for unsafe programs requires
placing them in separate address spaces.  As large address spaces become
available, and programmers use them to produce tightly-coupled applications,
safety becomes more and more important.

<P>
Unfortunately, it is generally impossible to program the lowest levels of a
system with complete safety.  Neither the compiler nor the runtime system can
check the validity of a bus address for an I/O controller, nor can they limit
the ensuing havoc if it is invalid.  This presents the language designer with
a dilemma.  If he holds out for safety, then low level code will have to be
programmed in another language.  But if he adopts unsafe features, then his
safety guarantee becomes void everywhere.

<P>
The languages of the BCPL family are full of unsafe features; the languages of
the Lisp family generally have none (or none that are documented).  In this
area Modula-3 follows the lead of Cedar by adopting a small number of unsafe
features that are allowed only in modules explicitly labeled unsafe.  In a
safe module, the compiler prevents any errors that could corrupt the runtime
system; in an unsafe module, it is the programmer's responsibility to avoid
them.

<P>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN> 1.4.6 Garbage collection.</A>
</H4>

<P>
A classic unsafe runtime error is to free a data structure that is still
reachable by active references (or ``dangling pointers'').  The error plants a
time bomb that explodes later, when the storage is reused.  If on the other
hand the programmer fails to free records that have become unreachable, the
result will be a ``storage leak'' and the computation space will grow without
bound.  Problems due to dangling pointers and storage leaks tend to persist
long after other errors have been found and removed.  The only sure way to
avoid these problems is the automatic freeing of unreachable storage, or
garbage collection.

<P>
Modula-3 therefore provides ``traced references'', which are like Modula-2
pointers except that the storage they point to is kept in the ``traced heap''
where it will be freed automatically when all references to it are gone.

<P>
Another great benefit of garbage collection is that it simplifies interfaces.
Without garbage collection, an interface must specify whether the client or
the implementation has the responsibility for freeing each allocated
reference, and the conditions under which it is safe to do so.  This can swamp
the interface in complexity.  For example, Modula-3 supports text strings by a
simple required interface <code>Text</code>, rather than with a built-in type.
Without garbage collection, this approach would not be nearly as attractive.

<P>
New refinements in garbage collection have appeared continually for more than
twenty years, but it is still difficult to implement efficiently.  For many
programs, the programming time saved by simplifying interfaces and eliminating
storage leaks and dangling pointers makes garbage collection a bargain, but
the lowest levels of a system may not be able to afford it.  For example, in
SRC's Topaz system, the part of the operating system that manages files and
heavy-weight processes relies on garbage collection, but the inner ``nub''
that implements virtual memory and thread context switching does not.
Essentially all Topaz application programs rely on garbage collection.

<P>
For programs that cannot afford garbage collection, Modula-3 provides a set of
reference types that are not traced by the garbage collector.  In most other
respects, traced and untraced references behave identically.

<P>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">0</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN> 1.4.7 Exceptions.</A>
</H4>

<P>
An exception is a control construct that exits many scopes at once.  Raising
an exception exits active scopes repeatedly until a handler is found for the
exception, and transfers control to the handler.  If there is no handler, the
computation terminates in some system-dependent way--for example, by entering
the debugger.

<P>
There are many arguments for and against exceptions, most of which revolve
around inconclusive issues of style and taste.  One argument in their favor
that has the weight of experience behind it is that exceptions are a good way
to handle any runtime error that is usually, but not necessarily, fatal.  If
exceptions are not available, each procedure that might encounter a runtime
error must return an additional code to the caller to identify whether an
error has occurred.  This can be clumsy, and has the practical drawback that
even careful programmers may inadvertently omit the test for the error return
code.  The frequency with which returned error codes are ignored has become
something of a standing joke in the Unix/C world.  Raising an exception is
more robust, since it stops the program unless there is an explicit handler
for it.

</H4>

<P>
Like all languages in the Algol family, Modula-3 is strongly typed.  The basic
idea of strong typing is to partition the value space into types, restrict
variables to hold values of a single type, and restrict operations to apply to
operands of fixed types.  In actuality, strong typing is rarely so simple.
For example, each of the following complications is present in at least one
language of the Algol family: a variable of type <code>[0..9]</code> may be safely
assigned to an <code>INTEGER</code>, but not vice-versa (subtyping).  Operations
like absolute value may apply both to <code>REAL</code>s and to <code>INTEGER</code>s
instead of to a single type (overloading).  The types of literals (for
example, <code>NIL</code>) can be ambiguous.  The type of an expression may be
determined by how it is used (target-typing).  Type mismatches may cause
automatic conversions instead of errors (as when a fractional real is rounded
upon assignment to an integer).

<P>
We adopted several principles in order to make Modula-3's type system as
uniform as possible.  First, there are no ambiguous types or target-typing:
the type of every expression is determined by its subexpressions, not by its
use.  Second, there are no automatic conversions.  In some cases the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">representation</SPAN> of a value changes when it is assigned (for example,
when assigning to a packed field of a record type) but the abstract value
itself is transferred without change.  Third, the rules for type compatibility
are defined in terms of a single subtype relation.  The subtype relation is
required for treating objects with inheritance, but it is also useful for
defining the type compatibility rules for conventional types.

</H4>

<P>
In the early days of the Ada project, a general in the Ada Program Office
opined that ``obviously the Department of Defense is not interested in an
artificially simplified language such as Pascal''.  Modula-3 represents the
opposite point of view.  We used every artifice that we could find or invent
to make the language simple.

<P>
C.A.R. Hoare has suggested that as a rule of thumb a language is too
complicated if it can't be described precisely and readably in fifty pages.
The Modula-3 committee elevated this to a design principle: we gave ourselves
a ``complexity budget'' of fifty pages, and chose the most useful features
that we could accommodate within this budget.  In the end, we were over budget
by six lines plus the syntax equations.  This policy is a bit arbitrary, but
there are so many good ideas in programming language design that some kind of
arbitrary budget seems necessary to keep a language from getting too
complicated.

<P>
In retrospect, the features that made the cut were directed toward two main
goals.  Interfaces, objects, generics, and threads provide fundamental
patterns of abstraction that help to structure large programs.  The isolation
of unsafe code, garbage collection, and exceptions help make programs safer
and more robust.  Of the techniques that we used to keep the language
internally consistent, the most important was the definition of a clean type
system based on a subtype relation.  There is no special novelty in any one of
these features individually, but there is simplicity and power in their
combination.

2.1 Definitions</A>
</H2>

<P>
A Modula-3 program specifies a computation that acts on a sequence of digital
components called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">locations</SPAN>.  A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">variable</SPAN> is a set of locations
that represents a mathematical value according to a convention determined by
the variable's <SPAN  CLASS="textit">type</SPAN>.  If a value can be represented by some variable of
type <code>T</code>, then we say that the value is a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">member</SPAN> of <code>T</code> and
<code>T</code> <SPAN  CLASS="textit">contains</SPAN> the value.

<P>
An <SPAN  CLASS="textit">identifier</SPAN> is a symbol declared as a name for a variable, type,
procedure, etc.  The region of the program over which a declaration applies is
called the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">scope</SPAN> of the declaration.  Scopes can be nested.  The
meaning of an identifier is determined by the smallest enclosing scope in
which the identifier is declared.

<P>
An <SPAN  CLASS="textit">expression</SPAN> specifies a computation that produces a value or
variable.  Expressions that produce variables are called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">designators</SPAN>.
A designator can denote either a variable or the value of that variable,
depending on the context.  Some designators are <SPAN  CLASS="textit">readonly</SPAN>, which means
that they cannot be used in contexts that might change the value of the
variable.  A designator that is not readonly is called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">writable</SPAN>.
Expressions whose values can be determined statically are called
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">constant expressions</SPAN> ; they are never designators.

<P>
A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">static error</SPAN> is an error that the implementation must detect before
program execution.  Violations of the language definition are static errors
unless they are explicitly classified as runtime errors.

<P>
A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">checked runtime error</SPAN> is an error that the implementation must detect
and report at runtime.  The method for reporting such errors is
implementation-dependent.  (If the implementation maps them into exceptions,
then a program could handle these exceptions and continue.)

<P>
An <SPAN  CLASS="textit">unchecked runtime error</SPAN> is an error that is not guaranteed to be
detected, and can cause the subsequent behavior of the computation to be
arbitrary.  Unchecked runtime errors can occur only in unsafe modules.

Modula-3 uses structural equivalence, instead of the name equivalence of
Modula-2.  Two types are the same if their definitions become the same when
expanded; that is, when all constant expressions are replaced by their values
and all type names are replaced by their definitions.  In the case of recursive
types, the expansion is the infinite limit of the partial expansions.  A type
expression is generally allowed wherever a type is required.

<P>
A type is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">empty</SPAN> if it contains no values.  For example, <code>[1..0]</code>
is an empty type.  Empty types can be used to build non-empty types (for
example, <code>SET OF [1..0]</code>, which is not empty because it contains the
empty set).  It is a static error to declare a variable of an empty type.

<P>
Every expression has a statically-determined type, which contains every value
that the expression can produce.  The type of a designator is the type of the
variable it produces.

<P>
Assignability and type compatibility are defined in terms of a single
syntactically specified subtype relation with the property that if <code>T</code> is
a subtype of <code>U</code>, then every member of <code>T</code> is a member of <code>U</code>.
The subtype relation is reflexive and transitive.

<P>
Every expression has a unique type, but a value can be a member of many types.
For example, the value <code>6</code> is a member of both <code>[0..9]</code> and
<code>INTEGER</code>.  It would be ambiguous to talk about ``the type of a value''.
Thus the phrase ``type of <code>x</code>'' means ``type of the expression
<code>x</code>'', while ``<code>x</code> is a member of <code>T</code>'' means ``the value of
<code>x</code> is a member of <code>T</code>''.

<P>
However, there is one sense in which a value can be said to have a type: every
object or traced reference value includes a code for a type, called the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">allocated type</SPAN> of the reference value.  The allocated type is tested by
<code>TYPECASE</code>.

<P>
There are three kinds of ordinal types: enumerations, subranges, and integers.

<P>
There are two integer types, which in order of increasing range 
are <code>INTEGER</code> and <code>LONGINT</code>.

<P>
An enumeration type is declared like this:
<PRE>
    TYPE T = {id_1, id_2, ..., id_n}
</PRE>
where the <code>id</code>'s are distinct identifiers.  The type <code>T</code> is an
ordered set of <code>n</code> values; the expression <code>T.id_</code><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

 SRC="m3-defn-completeimg1.png"
 ALT="$i$"></SPAN>'th value of the type in increasing order.  The empty enumeration
<code>{ }</code> is allowed.

<P>
Integers and enumeration elements are collectively called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ordinal
  values</SPAN>.  The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">base type</SPAN> of an ordinal value <code>v</code> is
<code>INTEGER</code> (or <code>LONGINT</code>) if <code>v</code> is an integer (or extended
range integer, respectively), otherwise it is the unique enumeration type
that contains <code>v</code>.

<P>
A subrange type is declared like this:
<PRE>
    TYPE T = [Lo..Hi]
</PRE>
where <code>Lo</code> and <code>Hi</code> are two ordinal values with the same base type,
called the base type of the subrange.  The values of <code>T</code> are all the
values from <code>Lo</code> to <code>Hi</code> inclusive.  <code>Lo</code> and <code>Hi</code> must be
constant expressions.  If <code>Lo</code> exceeds <code>Hi</code>, the subrange is empty.

<P>
The operators <code>ORD</code> and <code>VAL</code> convert between enumerations and
integers.  The operators <code>FIRST</code>, <code>LAST</code>, and <code>NUMBER</code> applied
to an ordinal type return the first element, last element, and number of
elements, respectively.

The first 256 elements of type <code>CHAR</code> represent characters in the
ISO-Latin-1 code, which is an extension of ASCII.  
The first 65536 elements of type <code>WIDECHAR</code> represent characters in the
Unicode character code.  
The language does not specify the names of the elements of the <code>CHAR</code> 
or <code>WIDECHAR</code> enumerations.  The syntax
for character literals is specified in the section on literals.  <code>FALSE</code>
and <code>TRUE</code> are predeclared synonyms for <code>BOOLEAN.FALSE</code> and
<code>BOOLEAN.TRUE</code>.

<P>
Each distinct enumeration type introduces a new collection of values, but a
subrange type reuses the values from the underlying type.  For example:
<PRE>
    TYPE
       T1 = {A, B, C};
       T2 = {A, B, C};
       U1 = [T1.A..T1.C];
       U2 = [T1.A..T2.C];  (* sic *)
       V =   {A, B}
</PRE>
<code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> are the same type, since they have the same expanded
definition.  In particular, <code>T1.C = T2.C</code> and therefore <code>U1</code> and
<code>U2</code> are also the same type.  But the types <code>T1</code> and <code>U1</code> are
distinct, although they contain the same values, because the expanded
definition of <code>T1</code> is an enumeration while the expanded definition of
<code>U1</code> is a subrange.  The type <code>V</code> is a third type whose values
<code>V.A</code> and <code>V.B</code> are not related to the values <code>T1.A</code> and
<code>T1.B</code>.

2.2.3 Arrays</A>
</H3>

<P>
An <SPAN  CLASS="textit">array</SPAN> is an indexed collection of component variables, called the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">elements</SPAN> of the array.  The indexes are the values of an ordinal type,
called the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">index type</SPAN> of the array.  The elements all have the same
size and the same type, called the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">element type</SPAN> of the array.

<P>
There are two kinds of array types, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">fixed</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">open</SPAN>.  The length
of a fixed array is determined at compile time.  The length of an open array
type is determined at runtime, when it is allocated or bound.  The length
cannot be changed thereafter.

<P>
The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">shape</SPAN> of a multi-dimensional array is the sequence of its lengths
in each dimension.  More precisely, the shape of an array is its length
followed by the shape of any of its elements; the shape of a non-array is the
empty sequence.

<P>
Arrays are assignable if they have the same element type and shape.  If either
the source or target of the assignment is an open array, a runtime shape check
is required.

<P>
A fixed array type declaration has the form:
<PRE>
    TYPE T = ARRAY Index OF Element
</PRE>
where <code>Index</code> is an ordinal type and <code>Element</code> is any type other
than an open array type.  The values of type <code>T</code> are arrays whose element
type is <code>Element</code> and whose length is the number of elements of the type
<code>Index</code>.  If <code>Element</code> is an empty type, then so is <code>T</code>.

<P>
If <code>a</code> has type <code>T</code>, then <code>a[i]</code> designates the element of
<code>a</code> whose position corresponds to the position of <code>i</code> in
<code>Index</code>.  For example, consider the declarations:
<PRE>
    VAR a := ARRAY [1..3] OF REAL {1.0, 2.0, 3.0};
    VAR b: ARRAY [-1..1] OF REAL := a;
</PRE>
Now <code>a = b</code> is <code>TRUE</code>; yet <code>a[1] = 1.0</code> while
<code>b[1] = 3.0</code>.  The interpretation of indexes is determined by an array's
type, not its value; the assignment <code>b := a</code> changes <code>b</code>'s value,
not its type.  (This example uses variable initialization, and array
constructors.)

<P>
An expression of the form:
<PRE>
    ARRAY Index_1, ..., Index_n OF Element
</PRE>
is shorthand for:
<PRE>
    ARRAY Index_1 OF ... OF ARRAY Index_n OF Element
</PRE>
This shorthand is eliminated from the expanded type definition used to define
structural equivalence.  An expression of the form <code>a[i_1, ..., i_n]</code> is
shorthand for <code>a[i_1]...[i_n]</code>.

<P>
An open array type declaration has the form:
<PRE>
    TYPE T = ARRAY OF Element
</PRE>
where <code>Element</code> is any type.  The values of <code>T</code> are arrays whose
element type is <code>Element</code> and whose length is arbitrary.  The index type
of an open array is the integer subrange <code>[0..n-1]</code>, where <code>n</code> is
the length of the array.   If <code>Element</code> is an empty type, then so 
is <code>T</code>.

<P>
An open array type can be used only as the type of a formal parameter, the
referent of a reference type, the element type of another open array type, or
as the type in an array constructor.

<P>
Examples of array types:
<PRE>
    TYPE
       Transform = ARRAY [1..3], [1..3] OF REAL;

A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">record</SPAN> is a sequence of named variables, called the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">fields</SPAN> of
the record.  Different fields can have different types.  The name and type of
each field is statically determined by the record's type.  The expression
<code>r.f</code> designates the field named <code>f</code> in the record <code>r</code>.

A record type declaration has the form:

where <code>fieldName</code> is an identifier, <code>Type</code> is any non-empty type
other than an open array type, and <code>default</code> is a constant expression.
The field names must be distinct.  A record is a member of <code>T</code> if it has
fields with the given names and types, in the given order, and no other
fields.  Empty records are allowed.

<P>
The constant <code>default</code> is a default value used when a record is
constructed or allocated.  Either ``<code>:= default</code>'' or ``<code>: Type</code>''
can be omitted, but not both.  If <code>Type</code> is omitted, it is taken to be
the type of <code>default</code>.  If both are present, the value of <code>default</code>
must be a member of <code>Type</code>.

<P>
When a series of fields shares the same type and default, any <code>fieldName</code>
can be a list of identifiers separated by commas.  Such a list is shorthand
for a list in which the type and default are repeated for each identifier.
That is:
<PRE>
    f_1, ..., f_m: Type := default

is shorthand for:

<LI><code>Mode</code> is a parameter mode, which can be <code>VALUE</code>, <code>VAR</code>,
  or <code>READONLY</code>.  If <code>Mode</code> is omitted, it defaults to <code>VALUE</code>.
</LI>
<LI><code>Name</code> is an identifier that names the parameter.  The parameter
  names must be distinct.
</LI>
<LI><code>Type</code> is the type of the parameter.
</LI>
<LI><code>Default</code> is a constant expression, the default value for the
  parameter.  If <code>Mode</code> is <code>VAR</code>, ``<code>:= Default</code>'' must be
  omitted, otherwise either ``<code>:= Default</code>'' or ``<code>: Type</code>'' can be
  omitted, but not both.  If <code>Type</code> is omitted, it is taken to be the
  type of <code>Default</code>. If both are present, the value of <code>Default</code>
  must be a member of <code>Type</code>.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
When a series of parameters share the same mode, type, and default,
<code>Name</code> can be a list of identifiers separated by commas.  Such a list is
shorthand for a list in which the mode, type, and default are repeated for
each identifier.  That is:
<PRE>
    Mode v_1, ..., v_n: Type := Default
</PRE>
is shorthand for:
<PRE>
    Mode v_1: Type := Default; ...; Mode v_n: Type := Default
</PRE>
This shorthand is eliminated from the expanded definition of the type.  The
default values are included.

<P>
A procedure value <code>P</code> is a member of the type <code>T</code> if it is
<code>NIL</code> or its signature is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">covered</SPAN> by the signature of <code>T</code>,
where <code>signature_1</code> covers <code>signature_2</code> if:

<UL>
<LI>They have the same number of parameters, and corresponding parameters
  have the same type and mode.
</LI>
<LI>They have the same result type, or neither has a result type.
</LI>
<LI>The raises set of <code>signature_1</code> contains the raises set of
  <code>signature_2</code>.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The parameter names and defaults affect the type of a procedure, but not its
value.  For example, consider the declarations:
<PRE>
    PROCEDURE P(txt: TEXT := "P") =
      BEGIN
        Wr.PutText(Stdio.stdout, txt)
      END P;

    VAR q: PROCEDURE(txt: TEXT := "Q") := P;
</PRE>
Now <code>P = q</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, yet <code>P()</code> prints ``<code>P</code>'' and
<code>q()</code> prints ``<code>Q</code>''.  The interpretation of defaulted parameters is
determined by a procedure's type, not its value; the assignment <code>q := P</code>
changes <code>q</code>'s value, not its type.

<P>
Examples of procedure types:
<PRE>
    TYPE
      Integrand = PROCEDURE (x: REAL): REAL;
      Integrator = PROCEDURE(f: Integrand; lo, hi: REAL): REAL;

      TokenIterator = PROCEDURE(VAR t: Token) RAISES {TokenError};

      RenderProc = PROCEDURE(
        scene: REFANY;
        READONLY t: Transform := Identity)
</PRE>

<P>
In a procedure type, <code>RAISES</code> binds to the closest preceding
<code>PROCEDURE</code>.  That is, the parentheses are required in:
<PRE>
    TYPE T = PROCEDURE (): (PROCEDURE ()) RAISES {}
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00015900000000000000">
2.2.9 Objects</A>
</H3>

<P>
An <SPAN  CLASS="textit">object</SPAN> is either <code>NIL</code> or a reference to a data record paired
with a method suite, which is a record of procedures that will accept the
object as a first argument.

<P>
An object type determines the types of a prefix of the fields of the data
record, as if ``<code>OBJECT</code>'' were ``<code>REF RECORD</code>''.  But in the case
of an object type, the data record can contain additional fields introduced by
subtypes of the object type.  Similarly, the object type determines a prefix
of the method suite, but the suite can contain additional methods introduced
by subtypes.

<P>
If <code>o</code> is an object, then <code>o.f</code> designates the data field named
<code>f</code> in <code>o</code>'s data record.  If <code>m</code> is one of <code>o</code>'s methods,
an invocation of the form <code>o.m(...)</code> denotes an execution of <code>o</code>'s
<code>m</code> method.  An object's methods can be invoked, but not read or written.

<P>
If <code>T</code> is an object type and <code>m</code> is the name of one of <code>T</code>'s
methods, then <code>T.m</code> denotes <code>T</code>'s <code>m</code> method.  This notation
makes it convenient for a subtype method to invoke the corresponding method of
one of its supertypes.

<P>
A field or method in a subtype masks any field or method with the same name in
the supertype.  To access such a masked field, use <code>NARROW</code> to view the
subtype variable as a member of the supertype, as illustrated below.

<P>
Object assignment is reference assignment.  Objects cannot be dereferenced,
since the static type of an object variable does not determine the type of its
data record.  To copy the data record of one object into another, the fields
must be assigned individually.

<P>
There are two predeclared object types:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

The declaration of an object type has the form:
<PRE>
    TYPE T = ST OBJECT
               Fields
             METHODS
               Methods
             OVERRIDES
               Overrides
             END
</PRE>
where <code>ST</code> is an optional supertype, <code>Fields</code> is a list of field
declarations, exactly as in a record type, <code>Methods</code> is a list of
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">method declarations</SPAN> and <code>Overrides</code> is a list of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">method
  overrides</SPAN>.  The fields of <code>T</code> consist of the fields of <code>ST</code>
followed by the fields declared in <code>Fields</code>.  The methods of <code>T</code>
consist of the methods of <code>ST</code> modified by <code>Overrides</code> and followed
by the methods declared in <code>Methods</code>.  <code>T</code> has the same reference
class as <code>ST</code>.

<P>
The names introduced in <code>Fields</code> and <code>Methods</code> must be distinct from
one another and from the names overridden in <code>Overrides</code>.  If <code>ST</code>
is omitted, it defaults to <code>ROOT</code>.  If <code>ST</code> is untraced, then the
fields must not include traced types.  (This restriction is lifted in unsafe
modules.)  If <code>ST</code> is declared as an opaque type, the declaration of
<code>T</code> is legal only in scopes where <code>ST</code>'s concrete type is known to
be an object type.

<P>
The keyword <code>OBJECT</code> can optionally be preceded by ``<code>BRANDED</code>'' or
by ``<code>BRANDED b</code>'', where <code>b</code> is a text constant.  The meaning is
the same as in non-object reference types.

<P>
A method declaration has the form:
<PRE>
    m sig := proc
</PRE>
where <code>m</code> is an identifier, <code>sig</code> is a procedure signature, and
<code>proc</code> is a top-level procedure constant.  It specifies that <code>T</code>'s
<code>m</code> method has signature <code>sig</code> and value <code>proc</code>.  If
``<code>:= proc</code>'' is omitted, ``<code>:= NIL</code>'' is assumed.  If <code>proc</code>
is non-nil, its first parameter must have mode <code>VALUE</code> and type some
supertype of <code>T</code>, and dropping its first parameter must result in a
signature that is covered by <code>sig</code>.

<P>
A method override has the form:
<PRE>
    m := proc
</PRE>
where <code>m</code> is the name of a method of the supertype <code>ST</code> and
<code>proc</code> is a top-level procedure constant.  It specifies that the <code>m</code>
method for <code>T</code> is <code>proc</code>, rather than <code>ST.m</code>.  If <code>proc</code>
is non-nil, its first parameter must have mode <code>VALUE</code> and type some
supertype of <code>T</code>, and dropping its first parameter must result in a
signature that is covered by the signature of <code>ST</code>'s <code>m</code> method.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Examples.</SPAN>  Consider the following declarations:
<PRE>
    TYPE
      A  = OBJECT a: INTEGER; METHODS p() END;
      AB = A OBJECT b: INTEGER END;

    PROCEDURE Pa(self: A) = ... ;
    PROCEDURE Pab(self: AB) = ... ;
</PRE>
The procedures <code>Pa</code> and <code>Pab</code> are candidate values for the <code>p</code>
methods of objects of types <code>A</code> and <code>AB.</code> For example:
<PRE>
    TYPE T1 = AB OBJECT OVERRIDES p := Pab END
</PRE>
declares a type with an <code>AB</code> data record and a <code>p</code> method that
expects an <code>AB</code>.  <code>T1</code> is a valid subtype of <code>AB</code>.  Similarly,
<PRE>
    TYPE T2 = A OBJECT OVERRIDES p := Pa END
</PRE>
declares a type with an <code>A</code> data record and a method that expects an
<code>A</code>.  <code>T2</code> is a valid subtype of <code>A</code>.  A more interesting
example is:
<PRE>
    TYPE T3 = AB OBJECT OVERRIDES p := Pa END
</PRE>
which declares a type with an <code>AB</code> data record and a <code>p</code> method that
expects an <code>A</code>.  Since every <code>AB</code> is an <code>A</code>, the method is not
too choosy for the objects in which it will be placed.  <code>T3</code> is a valid
subtype of <code>AB</code>.  In contrast,
<PRE>
    TYPE T4 = A OBJECT OVERRIDES p := Pab END
</PRE>
attempts to declare a type with an <code>A</code> data record and a method that
expects an <code>AB</code>; since not every <code>A</code> is an <code>AB</code>, the method is
too choosy for the objects in which it would be placed.  The declaration of
<code>T4</code> is a static error.

<P>
The following example illustrates the difference between declaring a new
method and overriding an existing method.  After the declarations
<PRE>
    TYPE
      A = OBJECT METHODS m() := P END;
      B = A OBJECT OVERRIDES m := Q END;
      C = A OBJECT METHODS m() := Q END;

    VAR
      a := NEW(A); b := NEW(B); c := NEW(C);
</PRE>
we have that
<PRE>
    a.m()  activates  P(a)
    b.m()  activates  Q(b)
    c.m()  activates  Q(c)
</PRE>
So far there is no difference between overriding and extending.  But
<code>c</code>'s method suite has two methods, while <code>b</code>'s has only one, as can
be revealed if <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are viewed as members of type <code>A</code>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT"><code>NARROW(b, A).m()</code>   activates  <code>Q(b)</code></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT"><code>NARROW(c, A).m()</code>   activates  <code>P(c)</code></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Here <code>NARROW</code> is used to view a variable of a subtype as a value of its
supertype.  It is more often used for the opposite purpose, when it requires a
runtime check.

<P>
The last example uses object subtyping to define reusable queues.  First the
interface:
<PRE>
    TYPE
      Queue = RECORD head, tail: QueueElem END;
      QueueElem = OBJECT link: QueueElem END;

    PROCEDURE Insert (VAR q: Queue; x: QueueElem);
    PROCEDURE Delete (VAR q: Queue): QueueElem;
    PROCEDURE Clear  (VAR q: Queue);
</PRE>

<P>
Then an example client:
<PRE>
    TYPE
      IntQueueElem = QueueElem OBJECT val: INTEGER END;
    VAR
      q: Queue;
      x: IntQueueElem;
      ...
      Clear(q);
      x := NEW(IntQueueElem, val := 6);
      Insert(q, x);
      ...
      x := Delete(q)
</PRE>

<P>
Passing <code>x</code> to <code>Insert</code> is safe, since every <code>IntQueueElem</code> is
a <code>QueueElem</code>.  Assigning the result of <code>Delete</code> to <code>x</code> cannot
be guaranteed valid at compile-time, since other subtypes of <code>QueueElem</code>
can be inserted into <code>q</code>, but the assignment will produce a checked
runtime error if the source value is not a member of the target type.  Thus
<code>IntQueueElem</code> bears the same relation to <code>QueueElem</code> as
<code>[0..9]</code> bears to <code>INTEGER</code>.

Executing a statement produces a computation that can halt (normal outcome),
raise an exception, cause a checked runtime error, or loop forever.  If the
outcome is an exception, it can optionally be paired with an argument.

<P>
We define the semantics of <code>EXIT</code> and <code>RETURN</code> with exceptions
called the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">exit-exception</SPAN> and the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">return-exception</SPAN>.  The
exit-exception takes no argument; the return-exception takes an argument of
arbitrary type.  Programs cannot name these exceptions explicitly.

<P>
Implementations should speed up normal outcomes at the expense of exceptions
(except for the return-exception and exit-exception).  Expending a thousand
instructions per exception raised to save one instruction per procedure call
would be reasonable.

<P>
If an expression is evaluated as part of the execution of a statement, and the

2.3.1 Assignment</A>
</H3>

<P>
To specify the typechecking of assignment statements we need to define
``assignable'', which is a relation between types and types, between
expressions and variables, and between expressions and types.

<P>
A type <code>T</code> is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">assignable</SPAN> to a type <code>U</code> if:

<UL>
<LI><code>T &lt;: U</code>, or
</LI>
<LI><code>U &lt;: T</code> and <code>T</code> is an array or a reference type other than
  <code>ADDRESS</code> (This restriction is lifted in unsafe modules.), or
</LI>
<LI><code>T</code> and <code>U</code> are ordinal types with at least one member in
  common.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
An expression <code>e</code> is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">assignable</SPAN> to a variable <code>v</code> if:

<UL>
<LI>the type of <code>e</code> is assignable to the type of <code>v</code>, and
</LI>
<LI>the value of <code>e</code> is a member of the type of <code>v</code>, is not a
  local procedure, and if it is an array, then it has the same shape as
  <code>v</code>.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The first point can be checked statically; the others generally require
runtime checks.  Since there is no way to determine statically whether the
value of a procedure parameter is local or global, assigning a local procedure
is a runtime rather than a static error.

<P>
An expression e is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">assignable</SPAN> to a type <code>T</code> if e is assignable to
some variable of type <code>T</code>.  (If <code>T</code> is not an open array type, this
is the same as saying that <code>e</code> is assignable to any variable of type
<code>T</code>.)

<P>
An assignment statement has the form:
<PRE>
    v := e
</PRE>
where <code>v</code> is a writable designator and <code>e</code> is an expression
assignable to the variable designated by <code>v</code>.  The statement sets
<code>v</code> to the value of <code>e</code>.  The order of evaluation of <code>v</code> and
<code>e</code> is undefined, but <code>e</code> will be evaluated before <code>v</code> is
updated.  In particular, if <code>v</code> and <code>e</code> are overlapping subarrays,
the assignment is performed in such a way that no element is used as a target
before it is used as a source.

<P>
Examples of assignments:
<PRE>
    VAR
      x: REFANY;
      a: REF INTEGER;
      b: REF BOOLEAN;

    a := b;  (* static error *)
    x := a;  (* no possible error *)
    a := x   (* possible checked runtime error *)

<P>
The same comments would apply if <code>x</code> had an ordinal type with
non-overlapping subranges <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, or if <code>x</code> had an object
type and <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> had incompatible subtypes.  The type
<code>ADDRESS</code> is treated differently from other reference types, since a
runtime check cannot be performed on the assignment of raw addresses.  For
example:

    VAR
      x: ADDRESS;
      a: UNTRACED REF INTEGER;
      b: UNTRACED REF BOOLEAN;

    a := b;  (* static error *)

2.3.2 Procedure call</A>
</H3>

<P>
A procedure call has the form:
<PRE>
    P(Bindings)
</PRE>
where <code>P</code> is a procedure-valued expression and <code>Bindings</code> is a list
of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">keyword</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">positional</SPAN> bindings.  A keyword binding has the
form <code>name := actual</code>, where <code>actual</code> is an expression and
<code>name</code> is an identifier.  A positional binding has the form
<code>actual</code>, where <code>actual</code> is an expression.  When keyword and
positional bindings are mixed in a call, the positional bindings must precede
the keyword bindings.  If the list of bindings is empty, the parentheses are
still required.

<P>
The list of bindings is rewritten to fit the signature of <code>P</code>'s type as
follows: First, each positional binding <code>actual</code> is converted and added
to the list of keyword bindings by supplying the name of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="m3-defn-completeimg1.png"
 ALT="$i$"></SPAN>'th formal
parameter, where <code>actual</code> is the i'th binding in <code>Bindings</code>.
Second, for each parameter that has a default and is not bound after the first
step, the binding <code>name := default</code> is added to the list of bindings,
where <code>name</code> is the name of the parameter and <code>default</code> is its
default value.  The rewritten list of bindings must bind only formal
parameters and must bind each formal parameter exactly once.  For example,
suppose that the type of <code>P</code> is
<PRE>
    PROCEDURE(ch: CHAR; n: INTEGER := 0)
</PRE>
Then the following calls are all equivalent:
<PRE>
    P('a', 0)
    P('a')
    P(ch := 'a')
    P(n := 0, ch := 'a')
    P('a', n := 0)
</PRE>
The call <code>P()</code> is illegal, since it doesn't bind <code>ch</code>.  The call
<code>P(n := 0, 'a')</code> is illegal, since it has a keyword parameter before a
positional parameter.

<P>
For a <code>READONLY</code> or <code>VALUE</code> parameter, the actual can be any
expression assignable to the type of the formal (except that the prohibition
against assigning local procedures is relaxed).  For a <code>VAR</code> parameter,
the actual must be a writable designator whose type is the same as that of the
formal, or, in case of a <code>VAR</code> array parameter, assignable to that of the
formal (see the section on designators).

<P>
A <code>VAR</code> formal is bound to the variable designated by the corresponding
actual; that is, it is aliased.  A <code>VALUE</code> formal is bound to a variable
with an unused location and initialized to the value of the corresponding
actual.  A <code>READONLY</code> formal is treated as a <code>VAR</code> formal if the
actual is a designator and the type of the actual is the same as the type of
the formal (or an array type that is assignable to the type of the formal);
otherwise it is treated as a <code>VALUE</code> formal.

<P>
Implementations are allowed to forbid <code>VAR</code> or <code>READONLY</code> parameters
of packed types.

<P>
To execute the call, the procedure <code>P</code> and its arguments are evaluated,
the formal parameters are bound, and the body of the procedure is executed.
The order of evaluation of <code>P</code> and its actual arguments is undefined.  It
is a checked runtime error to call an undefined or <code>NIL</code> procedure.

<P>
It is a checked runtime error for a procedure to raise an exception not
included in its raises set (If an implementation maps this runtime error into
an exception, the exception is implicitly included in all RAISES clauses.) or
for a function procedure to fail to return a result.

<P>
A procedure call is a statement only if the procedure is proper.  To call a
function procedure and discard its result, use <code>EVAL</code>.

<P>
A procedure call can also have the form:
<PRE>
    o.m(Bindings)
</PRE>
where <code>o</code> is an object and <code>m</code> names one of <code>o</code>'s methods.
This is equivalent to:

2.4.3 Variables</A>

<P>
If <code>id</code> is an identifier, <code>T</code> a non-empty type other than an open
array type, and <code>E</code> an expression, then:
<PRE>
    VAR id: T := E
</PRE>
declares <code>id</code> as a variable of type <code>T</code> whose initial value is the
value of <code>E</code>.  Either ``<code>:= E</code>'' or ``<code>: T</code>'' can be omitted,
but not both.  If <code>T</code> is omitted, it is taken to be the type of <code>E</code>.
If <code>E</code> is omitted, the initial value is an arbitrary value of type
<code>T</code>.  If both are present, <code>E</code> must be assignable to <code>T</code>.

<P>
The initial value is a shorthand that is equivalent to inserting the
assignment <code>id := E</code> at the beginning of the executable part of the
block.  If several variables have initial values, their assignments are
inserted in the order they are declared.  For example:
<PRE>
    VAR i: [0..5] := j; j: [0..5] := i; BEGIN S END
</PRE>
initializes <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> to the same arbitrary value in
<code>[0..5]</code>; it is equivalent to:
<PRE>
    VAR i: [0..5]; j: [0..5]; BEGIN i := j; j := i; S END
</PRE>

<P>
If a sequence of identifiers share the same type and initial value, <code>id</code>
can be a list of identifiers separated by commas.  Such a list is shorthand
for a list in which the type and initial value are repeated for each
identifier.  That is:
<PRE>
    VAR v_1, ..., v_n: T := E
</PRE>
is shorthand for:
<PRE>
    VAR v_1: T := E; ...; VAR v_n: T := E
</PRE>
This means that <code>E</code> is evaluated n times.

where <code>id</code> is an identifier, <code>sig</code> is a procedure signature, and
<code>B</code> is a block.  In both cases, the type of <code>id</code> is the procedure
type determined by <code>sig</code>.  The first form is allowed only in modules; the
second form is allowed only in interfaces.

<P>
The first form declares <code>id</code> as a procedure constant whose signature is
<code>sig</code>, whose body is <code>B</code>, and whose environment is the scope
containing the declaration.  The parameter names are treated as if they were
declared at the outer level of <code>B</code>; the parameter types and default
values are evaluated in the scope containing the procedure declaration.  The
procedure name <code>id</code> must be repeated after the <code>END</code> that terminates
the body.

<P>
The second form declares <code>id</code> to be a procedure constant whose signature
is <code>sig</code>.  The procedure body is specified in a module exporting the

An <SPAN  CLASS="textit">opaque type</SPAN> is a name that denotes an unknown subtype of some given

There are two kinds of revelations, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">partial</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">complete</SPAN>.  A
program can contain any number of partial revelations for an opaque type; it
must contain exactly one complete revelation.

<P>
A partial revelation has the form:
<PRE>
    REVEAL T &lt;: V
</PRE>
where <code>V</code> is a type expression (possibly just a name) and <code>T</code> is an
identifier (possibly qualified) declared as an opaque type.  It reveals that
<code>V</code> is a supertype of <code>T</code>.

<P>
In any scope, the revealed supertypes of an opaque type must be linearly
ordered by the subtype relation.  That is, if it is revealed that
<code>T &lt;: U1</code> and <code>T &lt;: U2</code>, it must also be revealed either that
<code>U1 &lt;: U2</code> or that <code>U2 &lt;: U1</code>.

<P>
A complete revelation has the form:
<PRE>
    REVEAL T = V
</PRE>
where <code>V</code> is a type expression (not just a name) whose outermost type
constructor is a branded reference or object type and <code>T</code> is an
identifier (possibly qualified) that has been declared as an opaque type.  The
revelation specifies that <code>V</code> is the concrete type for <code>T</code>.  It is a
static error if any type revealed in any scope as a supertype of <code>T</code> is
not a supertype of <code>V</code>.  Generally this error is detected at link time.

<P>
Distinct opaque types have distinct concrete types, since <code>V</code> includes a
brand and all brands in a program are distinct.

<P>
A revelation is allowed only in an interface or in the outermost scope of a
module.  A revelation in an interface can be imported into any scope where it
is required, as illustrated by the stack example.

For example, consider:
<PRE>
    INTERFACE I; TYPE T &lt;: ROOT; PROCEDURE P(x:T): T; END I.

    INTERFACE IRep; IMPORT I;
      REVEAL I.T = MUTEX BRANDED OBJECT count: INTEGER END;

An importer of <code>I</code> sees <code>I.T</code> as an opaque subtype of <code>ROOT</code>,
and is limited to allocating objects of type <code>I.T</code>, passing them to
<code>I.P</code>, or declaring subtypes of <code>I.T</code>.  An importer of <code>IClass</code>
sees that every <code>I.T</code> is a <code>MUTEX</code>, and can therefore lock objects
of type <code>I.T</code>.  Finally, an importer of <code>IRep</code> sees the concrete

A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">module</SPAN> is like a block, except for the visibility of names.  An entity

A module <code>X</code> <SPAN  CLASS="textit">exports</SPAN> an interface <code>I</code> to supply bodies for
one or more of the procedures declared in the interface.  A module or

<P>
A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">program</SPAN> is a collection of modules and interfaces that contains every

Program execution terminates when the body of the main module terminates, even

There are two forms of import statements.  All imports of both forms are

<P>
The first form is
<PRE>
    IMPORT I AS J
</PRE>
which imports the interface whose global name is <code>I</code> and gives it the
local name <code>J</code>.  The entities and revelations declared in <code>I</code> become
accessible in the importing module or interface, but the entities and

The statement <code>IMPORT I</code> is short for <code>IMPORT I AS I</code>.

<P>
The second form is

precedence over a global binding.  For example,
<PRE>
    IMPORT I AS J, J AS I; FROM I IMPORT N

simultaneously introduces local names <code>J</code>, <code>I</code>, and <code>N</code> for the
entities whose global names are <code>I</code>, <code>J</code>, and <code>J.N</code>,
respectively.

declared in <code>I</code> can be redeclared in <code>M</code>, with a body.  The
signature in <code>M</code> must be covered by the signature in <code>I</code>.  To
determine the interpretation of keyword bindings and parameter defaults in
calls to the procedure, the signature in <code>M</code> is used within <code>M</code>; the
signature in <code>I</code> is used everywhere else.

<P>
Except for the redeclaration of exported procedures, the names declared at the
top level of <code>Block</code>, the visible imported names, and the names declared
in the exported interfaces must be distinct.

<P>
For example, the following is illegal, since two names in exported interfaces
coincide:

The following is also illegal, since the visible imported name <code>X</code>
coincides with the top-level name <code>X</code>:
<PRE>
    INTERFACE I;
      PROCEDURE X();  ...

    MODULE M EXPORTS I;
      FROM I IMPORT X;
      PROCEDURE X() = ...;

But the following is legal, although peculiar:
<PRE>
    INTERFACE I;
      PROCEDURE X(...);  ...

    MODULE M EXPORTS I;
      IMPORT I;
      PROCEDURE X(...) = ...;
</PRE>
since the only visible imported name is <code>I</code>, and the coincidence between
<code>X</code> as a top-level name and <code>X</code> as a name in an exported interface
is allowed, assuming the interface signature covers the module signature.
Within <code>M</code>, the interface declaration determines the signature of

Syntactically, an expression is either an operand, or an operation applied to
arguments, which are themselves expressions.  Operands are identifiers,

The formal type <code>Any</code> specifies an argument of any type.

<P>
A single operation name can be overloaded, which means that it denotes more
than one operation.  In this case, we write a separate signature for each of
the operations.  For example:
<PRE>
    ABS (x: Integer) : Integer
        (x: Float)   : Float
</PRE>
The particular operation will be selected so that each actual argument type is
a subtype of the corresponding formal type or a member of the corresponding
formal type class.  This selection is always unambiguous. 

<P>
The argument to an operation can be an expression denoting a type.  In this
case, we write <code>Type</code> as the argument type.  For example:
<PRE>
    BYTESIZE (T: Type): CARDINAL
</PRE>
The result type of an operation can depend on its argument values (although
the result type can always be determined statically).  In this case, the
expression for the result type contains the appropriate arguments.  For
example:
<PRE>
    FIRST (T: FixedArrayType): IndexType(T)
</PRE>
<code>IndexType(T)</code> denotes the index type of the array type <code>T</code> and
<code>IndexType(a)</code> denotes the index type of the array <code>a</code>.  The
definitions of <code>ElemType(T)</code> and <code>ElemType(a)</code> are similar.

<P>
Numeric literals denote constant non-negative integers or reals.  The types of
these literals are <code>INTEGER</code>, <code>LONGINT</code>, <code>REAL</code>,
<code>LONGREAL</code>, and <code>EXTENDED</code>.

<P>
A literal <code>INTEGER</code> has the form <code>base_digits</code>, where <code>base</code> is
one of ``<code>2</code>'', ``<code>3</code>'', ..., ``<code>16</code>'', and <code>digits</code> is a
non-empty sequence of the decimal digits <code>0</code> through <code>9</code> plus the
hexadecimal digits <code>A</code> through <code>F</code>.  The ``<code>base_</code>'' can be
omitted, in which case <code>base</code> defaults to <code>10</code>.  The digits are
interpreted in the given base.  Each digit must be less than <code>base</code>.  For
example, <code>16_FF</code> and <code>255</code> are equivalent integer literals.

<P>
If no explicit base is present, the value of the literal must be at most
<code>LAST(INTEGER)</code>.  If an explicit base is present, the value of the
literal must be less than <code>2^Word.Size</code>, and its interpretation uses the
convention of the <code>Word</code> interface.  For example, on a 32-bit two's
complement machine, <code>16_FFFFFFFF</code> and <code>-1</code> represent the same value.

<P>
A literal <code>LONGINT</code> has the form <code>integer L</code>, where <code>integer</code>
has the same form as a literal <code>INTEGER</code>.  If no explicit base is
present, the value of the literal must be at most <code>LAST(LONGINT)</code>.  If an
explicit base is present, the value of the literal must be less than
<code>2^Long.Size</code>, and its interpretation uses the convention of the
<code>Long</code> interface.  For example, the <code>LONGINT</code> having the value zero
would be written <code>0L</code>.

<P>
A literal <code>REAL</code> has the form <code>decimal E exponent</code>, where
<code>decimal</code> is a non-empty sequence of decimal digits followed by a decimal
point followed by a non-empty sequence of decimal digits, and <code>exponent</code>
is a non-empty sequence of decimal digits optionally beginning with a <code>+</code>
or <code>-</code>.  The literal denotes <code>decimal</code> times <code>10^exponent</code>.  If
``<code>E exponent</code>'' is omitted, <code>exponent</code> defaults to <code>0</code>.

<P>
<code>LONGREAL</code> and <code>EXTENDED</code> literals are like <code>REAL</code> literals,
but instead of <code>E</code> they use <code>D</code> and <code>X</code> respectively.

<P>
Case is not significant in any letter in a numeric literal.  
Embedded spaces are not allowed in a numeric literal.

The hexadecimal digits are case-insensitive. 
The 'X' in a hexadecimal escape sequence is case-insensitive.  
A <code>\</code> that is not a part of one of these

A wide character literal has the form <code>W charlit</code>, where <code>charlit</code>
is like a character literal, except that an octal escape sequence
within must have exactly six octal digits, a hexadecimal escape sequence 
within must have exactly four hexadecimal digits. and the escape 
sequence <code>\U</code> followed by exactly six hexadecimal digits is allowed and
specifies the Unicode character whose code point has that hexadecimal value.  
It is a static error if that value lies outside the Unicode code point range. 
The 'U' in a Unicode escape sequence is case-insensitive.  
The type of a wide character literal is <code>WIDECHAR</code>.
The leading 'W' is case-insensitive.

Similarly, a wide text literal has the form <code>W textlit</code>,

Unlike character literals, ordinary text literals and wide text literals 
both have the type <code>TEXT</code>, differing only in the method of specifying 
the literal's value. 
The leading 'W' is case-insensitive.

where <code>S</code> is a set type and the <code>e</code>'s are expressions or ranges of
the form <code>lo..hi</code>.  The constructor denotes a value of type <code>S</code>

An array constructor has the form:
<PRE>
    A{e_1, ..., e_n}

where <code>A</code> is an array type and the <code>e</code>'s are expressions.  The
constructor denotes a value of type <code>A</code> containing the listed elements in
the listed order.  The <code>e</code>'s must be assignable to the element type of
<code>A</code>.  This means that if <code>A</code> is a multi-dimensional array, the

exactly once.  Each expression in the binding must be assignable to the type
of the corresponding record field.

An allocation operation has the form:

It is a static error if <code>T</code>'s referent type is empty.  If <code>T</code> is

The initial state of the referent generally represents an arbitrary value of

If <code>T</code> is a reference to an array with <code>k</code> open dimensions, the

where the <code>n</code>'s are integer-valued expressions that specify the lengths
of the new array in its first <code>k</code> dimensions.  The values in the array

where <code>Bindings</code> is a list of keyword bindings used to initialize the new
fields.  Positional bindings are not allowed.

Each binding <code>f := v</code> initializes the field <code>f</code> to the value
<code>v</code>.  Fields for which no binding is supplied will be initialized to
their defaults if they have defaults; otherwise they will be initialized to
arbitrary values of their types.

The order of the field bindings makes no difference.

If <code>T</code> is an object type then <code>Bindings</code> can also include method

Every object type or traced reference type (including NULL) has an associated

<code>ORD</code> converts an element of an enumeration to the integer that

<code>VAL</code> is the inverse of <code>ORD</code>; it converts from a numeric position
<code>i</code> into the element that occupies that position in an enumeration.  If
<code>T</code> is a subrange, <code>VAL</code> returns the element with the position
<code>i</code> in the original enumeration type, not the subrange.  It is a checked

For an ordinal type <code>T</code>, <code>NUMBER(T)</code> returns the number of elements

    --Aristotle</SPAN>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The features defined in this section can potentially cause unchecked runtime
errors and are thus forbidden in safe interfaces and modules.

<P>
An unchecked type transfer operation has the form:<PRE><TT>
 		 <code>LOOPHOLE</code> 		 <code>(e, T)</code>  
</TT></PRE>
where <code>e</code> is an expression whose type is not an open array type and
<code>T</code> is a type.  It denotes <code>e</code>'s bit pattern interpreted as a
variable or value of type <code>T</code>.  It is a designator if <code>e</code> is, and is
writable if <code>e</code> is.  An unchecked runtime error can occur if <code>e</code>'s
bit pattern is not a legal <code>T</code>, or if <code>e</code> is a designator and some
legal bit pattern for <code>T</code> is not legal for <code>e</code>.

<P>
If <code>T</code> is not an open array type, <code>BITSIZE(e)</code> must equal
<code>BITSIZE(T)</code>.  If <code>T</code> is an open array type, its element type must
not be an open array type, and <code>e</code>'s bit pattern is interpreted as an
array whose length is <code>BITSIZE(e)</code> divided by <code>BITSIZE(</code>the element
type of <code>T)</code>.  The division must come out even.

<P>
The following operations are primarily used for address arithmetic:<PRE><TT>
 		 		 <code>ADR</code> 		 <code>(VAR x: Any)            : ADDRESS</code> 
<BR>
infix 		 <code>+</code> 		 <code>(x: ADDRESS, y:INTEGER) : ADDRESS</code> 
<BR>
infix 		 <code>-</code> 		 <code>(x: ADDRESS, y:INTEGER) : ADDRESS</code> 
<BR>
infix 		 <code>-</code> 		 <code>(x,y: ADDRESS)          : INTEGER</code>  
</TT></PRE>
<code>ADR(x)</code> is the address of the variable <code>x</code>.  The actual argument
must be a designator but need not be writable.  The operations <code>+</code> and
<code>-</code> treat addresses as integers.  The validity of the addresses produced
by these operations is implementation-dependent.  For example, the address of
a variable in a local procedure frame is probably valid only for the duration
of the call.  The address of the referent of a traced reference is probably
valid only as long as traced references prevent it from being collected (and
not even that long if the implementation uses a compacting collector).

<P>
In unsafe modules the <code>INC</code> and <code>DEC</code> statements apply to addresses
as well as ordinals:<PRE><TT>
 		 <code>INC</code> 		 <code>(VAR x: ADDRESS; n: INTEGER := 1)</code> 
<BR><code>DEC</code> 		 <code>(VAR x: ADDRESS; n: INTEGER := 1)</code>  
</TT></PRE>
These are short for <code>x := x + n</code> and <code>x := x - n</code>, except that
<code>x</code> is evaluated only once.

<P>
A <code>DISPOSE</code> statement has the form:<PRE><TT>
 		 		 <code>DISPOSE</code> 		 <code>(v)</code>  
</TT></PRE>
where <code>v</code> is a writable designator whose type is not <code>REFANY</code>,
<code>ADDRESS</code>, or <code>NULL</code>.  If <code>v</code> is untraced, the statement frees
the storage for <code>v</code>'s referent and sets <code>v</code> to <code>NIL</code>.  Freeing
storage to which active references remain is an unchecked runtime error.  If
<code>v</code> is traced, the statement is equivalent to <code>v := NIL</code>.  If
<code>v</code> is <code>NIL</code>, the statement is a no-op.

<P>
In unsafe interfaces and modules the definition of ``assignable'' for types is
extended: two reference types <code>T</code> and <code>U</code> are assignable if
<code>T &lt;: U</code> or <code>U &lt;: T</code>.  The only effect of this change is to allow a
value of type <code>ADDRESS</code> to be assigned to a variable of type
<code>UNTRACED REF T</code>.  It is an unchecked runtime error if the value does not
address a variable of type <code>T</code>.

<P>
In unsafe interfaces and modules the type constructor <code>UNTRACED REF T</code> is
allowed for traced as well as untraced <code>T</code>, and the fields of untraced
objects can be traced.  If <code>u</code> is an untraced reference to a traced
variable <code>t</code>, then the validity of the traced references in <code>t</code> is
implementation-dependent, since the garbage collector probably will not trace
them through <code>u</code>.

<P>
To read a token, first skip all blanks, tabs, newlines, carriage returns,
vertical tabs, form feeds, comments, and pragmas.  Then read the longest
sequence of characters that forms an operator or an <code>Id</code> or
<code>Literal</code>.

<P>
An <code>Id</code> is a case-significant sequence of letters, digits, and
underscores that begins with a letter.  An <code>Id</code> is a keyword if it
appears in the list of keywords, a reserved identifier if it appears in the
list of reserved identifiers, and an ordinary identifier otherwise.

<P>
In the following grammar, terminals are characters surrounded by double-quotes
and the special terminal <code>DQUOTE</code> represents double-quote itself.
