There are some tricks to link Fortran and Modula-3 in this package.

The .s files were generated by the Intel ifort compiler.  Do not
delete them!  In a later implementation, we may have to move the
.s files to a different directory, in case we need to perform these
tricks on more than one architecture.

See m3makefile for more details.
