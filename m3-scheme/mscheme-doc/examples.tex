\section{Scodegen, a simple library for defining SQL database access}

Inspired by the popular Hibernate package for Java, the {\tt scodegen}
library is a simple library that allows a user to describe SQL schemas
in Scheme and generate Modula-3 code for conveniently accessing the
tables of that schema.  The {\tt scodegen} library is fully integrated
into the Modula-3 build system (the {\tt m3build} or {\tt cm3},
depending on which specific Modula-3 implementation is being used).

{\tt scodegen} itself is written entirely in Scheme but it interfaces
with a certain Modula-3 implementation of access to an SQL database.
It also interfaces with a Modula-3 generic, {\tt TableMonitor}, which
makes it very easy to write programs that use a ``monitoring''
semantics (poll a SQL database for changes and take some action based
on those changes).
