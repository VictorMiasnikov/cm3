This is a library which reads json text and allows
operations upon it.

The main data structure is Json.T which represents a node in
a Json tree. Each node has a type corresponding to the basic Json
types - array, object, text, int, float, bool and null.

ParseFile will parse a json text file and return
the root node to such a tree. ParseBuf and ParseStream are similar.

Format will produce the textural representaion from the encoded tree,
suitably formatted.

All other operations decorate the tree by adding, deleting and updating
nodes.
