(* WC21 is a variable-length encoding of widechar values, used only in
   pickles and net objects.  The standard Unicode encodings explicitly disallow
   surrogate code points as unencoded values.  Programs may have a legitimate 
   need to store and/or manipulate surrogate values in memory, and these should
   be picklable too.  WC21 supports the entire code point range, which requires
   21 bits.

   The first byte has 7 (least significant) data bits and one bit (msb of the 
   byte) that, if set, indicates another byte follows.  If present, the second 
   byte is just like the first and supplies the next more significant 7 data 
   bits.  If it calls for a third byte, that contains the 7 most significant 
   data bits.  The bytes are always in least- to most-significant order in the 
   pickle, regardless of endianness of writing or reading machine.
