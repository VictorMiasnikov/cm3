This insanely complicated web of generics and instantiations is a
way to avoid massive manual copying of source code.  To test array
constructors, many cases require constructors that are coded directly
inline.  Passing them in parameters often, adds, removes, or copies
dope.  We want to know some things about the original dope.

Even then, some tests are commented out because it seems impossible
to obtain an original dope addess and chech whether it is in one of
the static constant areas.  Perhaps some runtime addition of markers
therein would help.

In any case, much of this is a performance issue only.
