This Modula3 package contains Modula3 bindings to selected things in
llvm that are needed to interface to llvm.

Procedure bindings herein generally use code in three files:

1) Modula3 code in a .i3 file, that contains a (usually) zero-thickness
   Modula3-to-C binding.  This is just a PROCEDURE signature in
   Modula3 syntax, using types and parameteter modes equivalent to C
   types for parameters and results.  It, or the entire interface, has
   an <*EXTERNAL*> pragma, so the implementation, compiled by other than
   a Modula-3 compiler, can be linked-to. 

2) C code in a .h file, that contains a prototype for a plain C
   function.  This will be #included by C++ code, but contains 'extern
   "C"' so the C++ compiler will generate unmangled link names for its
   functions.  

3) C++ code in a .cpp file, that contains a wrapper function for
   calling a C++ function inside of llvm.  This latter is usually a
   member function of a class, and also often requires type
   conversions to/from llvm's C++-but-not-C types, so the wrapper must
   be in C++.

This package supplies 1) for everything provided.  The llvm project
supplies Core.h/Core.cpp, inside its source tree, which contain 2) and
3) for a set of functions chosen by llvm's developers.  LLVM.i3 is the
corresponding item 1). For others, this package supplies all three itself. 

What is in which binding is a bit willy-nilly, but here is the intended
principle:  LLVM.i3 is for whatever llvm's developers provided in Core.h/
Core.cpp, plus a few extra things supported by M3Extras.h/M3Extras.cpp.  
M3DIBuilder is for things found in llvm's DIBuilder. It contains a few 
declarations that might logically have been in Core, but aren't and are
needed by M3DIBuilder.       

The m3makefile will invoke make to do the C++ compilation.  It needs
variables giving the locations of llvm's include files, llvm's compiled
libraries, and other compiled libraries used by llvm.
