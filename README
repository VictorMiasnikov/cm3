To build everything, go to the `scripts` directory.
Before trying anything there, you need to download
a working compiler for your system;
you can obtain one by clicking on the `Releases` tab on the main Github page
and selecting one for your architecture.

The `README` in the `scripts` directory describes several options.
The `scripts` directory also contains a subdirectory of Python scripts
for those who prefer or need it.

The base system can be found in several packages in the collections
m3-sys and m3-libs. All the rest is more or less optional. Complete
documentation in HTML and other formats can be found in the doc
sub-directory.
